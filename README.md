## About

**The Ledger** is an offline-first, responsive web application for building and tracking characters in *Vampire: The Masquerade* 5th Edition (V5). Think of it as the digital equivalent of the classic paper character sheetâ€”always at hand, version-controlled, and ready to print.

The project started as a small experiment based on the 3D dice roller from [@prncc/vampire-dice-roller](https://github.com/prncc/vampire-dice-roller), and quickly grew after importing rules logic, data files, and plenty of inspiration from the fantastic [@Odin94/Progeny-vtm-v5-character-creator](https://github.com/Odin94/Progeny-vtm-v5-character-creator/). Huge thanks to both projects for lighting the way!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Ledger.git
   cd Ledger
   ```

2. **Install** dev dependencies (only needed if you want to re-compile SCSS)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run** the SCSS watcher (optional)
   ```bash
   npm run sass
   ```

4. **Open** `index.html` in your favourite browser â€“ that's it! No build step required.

## Development

All styling lives in `scss/` and is compiled to `css/` using [`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/). The following npm scripts are available:

| Script | Purpose |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `npm run sass` | Watch `scss/` and re-compile on changes |
| `npm run sass:build` | One-off, minified production build |

For detailed technical documentation, see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md).
