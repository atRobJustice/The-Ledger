## About

**The Ledger** is an offline-first, responsive web application for building and tracking characters in *Vampire: The Masquerade* 5th Edition (V5).  Think of it as the digital equivalent of the classic paper character sheetâ€”always at hand, version-controlled, and ready to print.

The project started as a small experiment based on the 3D dice roller from
[@prncc/vampire-dice-roller](https://github.com/prncc/vampire-dice-roller) ðŸ©¸, and quickly grew after importing rules logic, data files, and plenty of inspiration from the fantastic
[@Odin94/Progeny-vtm-v5-character-creator](https://github.com/Odin94/Progeny-vtm-v5-character-creator/) ðŸ¦‡.  Huge thanks to both projects for lighting the way!

## Features

- ðŸ“„ All core V5 character sheet sections: Information, Attributes, Skills, Disciplines, Backgrounds, Advantages & Flaws, Coterie and more.
- ðŸŽ² Optional 3-D dice roller overlay (ported from `vampire-dice-roller`).
- ðŸ’¾ 100 % client-side â€“ nothing is sent to a server; your secrets stay yours.
- ðŸ“¥ Export / import character data as JSON for quick backups or version control.
- ðŸ“š Comprehensive V5 reference data automatically pulled from the community-maintained [VTM Wiki](https://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/VTM_Wiki).
- ðŸ“¤ Discord integration â€“ share dice rolls to your server via a webhook.
- ðŸ§¬ Import existing character JSON from the **Progeny** VTM character creator.
- ðŸŽ¨ Built with vanilla HTML, SCSS (compiled via `sass`), and a sprinkle of Bootstrap 5 for layout.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Ledger.git
   cd Ledger
   ```

2. **Install** dev dependencies (only needed if you want to re-compile SCSS)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run** the SCSS watcher (optional)

   ```bash
   npm run sass
   ```

4. **Open** `index.html` in your favourite browser â€“ that's it!  No build step required.

## Development

All styling lives in `scss/` and is compiled to `css/` using [`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/).  The following npm scripts are available:

| Script         | Purpose                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `npm run sass` | Watch `scss/` and re-compile on changes   |
| `npm run sass:build` | One-off, minified production build |

Feel free to raise issues or open pull requests â€“ contributions are welcome!
