### Changed
- Control Bar deduplication: `dice-overlay.js` now relies on `control-bar.js`, eliminating duplicate UI/button logic and making the bar the single source of truth.
- Refactored SCSS to remove remaining hard-coded colours.  Introduced additional design-token variables (`$color-white`, `$color-black`, grayscale palette, etc.) and CSS custom properties (`--accent`, `--panel-*`, `--form-*`) so that every component inherits the active theme automatically.

- Updated hover/focus states and disabled styles to respect the new variables.
- Control Bar redesign: now a fixed footer that never blocks content. Buttons are grouped (Quick Dice, Mend, Data, Integrations, Theme, Info) with dividers, secondary actions use compact icons, detailed tooltips added, WP Reroll pulses when usable, and Progeny/Discord icons are center-aligned. Collapse handle removed.
