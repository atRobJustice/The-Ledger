  bane: {
    name: "Aesthetic Fixation",
    description: "A desire for beauty takes control over the Toreador and when in lesser surroundings they suffer. When they are within settings they find less than beautiful, they take a penalty equal to their Bane Severity when using Disciplines."

  variantBane: {
    name: "Agonizing Empathy",
    description: "Whenever their feeding causes Aggravated damage to a mortal, the vampire suffers the same damage in return but cannot receive more than their Bane Severity. This damage is generally Aggravated. The damage itself is reflected as vivid bruising wherever they bit their victim as internal bleeding takes place."

  compulsion: {
    name: "Obsession",
    description: "Utterly obsessed with a single thing, the Toreador cannot speak of anything but that object. Be it a person, a piece of artwork, a blood splatter in the right lighting, or the sunrise itself, they cannot take their attention from it. Any other actions receive a two-dice penalty. This Compulsion lasts until they can no longer perceive the object or the scene ends."

  background: {
    description: "Known for their seductive nature, enthralling demeanor, and eloquent grace to the point of obsession, Toreador vampires Embrace artists and lovers into their ranks, forever trying to stir their own deadened hearts. Supernaturally graceful and charming, the Divas are always looking for the next thrill, leaving a detritus of discarded lovers and victims in their wake.",
    nature: "A clan who exudes beauty, one who seeks out the aesthetics in life and holds their obsessions with it. However, it is a mistake to think of them as nothing but Divas and perverts. Beauty is power and the way they utilize love to influence those around them to do just about anything is an invaluable weapon."

    presence: "The power which they have mastered, using it in conjunction with Auspex to pierce and manipulate the minds of mortals and Kindred alike. Be it to engage in carnal pleasures or to take their fill of blood."

    anxiousGraduateStudent: "Once a wallflower at parties, they were embraced by their sire who saw more in them. The unlife has done them well as they expanded their comfort outside of their originally small social circles thanks to Presence.",
    eternalMuse: "A person of obsession they were embraced by their sire to stop the aging process and preserve their beauty for all to see.",
    dragQueen: "Artists, performers, and singers are magnets to most Toreadors. This one was no exception, embraced for their skills and talents and to thrive in unlife doing what they love.",
    outcast: "Perhaps their sire thought their skills were better or perhaps they didn't care. This Toreador was embraced, but their clan does not match them well. Without the artistry like others and the social skills to match, they struggle to thrive within their clan."

    embrace: {
      description: "Clan elders have stressed Toreador offers some selectiveness in their Embrace, going for those that live on the cutting edge of culture, thought, and the mainstream.",
      criteria: "Many Toreadors go for artist, a term that can mean someone who strive to perfect anything: painters, actors, sex workers, well connected managers, collectors, academics, etc. Anyone who can offer the clan new experience, stimulation, or entertainment is fair game for a good and proper embrace.",
      curse: "However, the Toreador curse also affects their judgment in Embraces. Not all their choices may be best on getting the best in the field, but rather some Embrace a one night stand that went too far. Their fangs may turn a hedonistic party boy, a one-hit wonder, or a beautiful person who lacks any skills."

    mortalSociety: {
      influence: "Given the aims of their embrace it is not too surprising the Toreadors hold a lot of influence in mortal society. Toreadors clutch to the industries that grasp at human stimulation and culture: television, news, music, art, wine bars, nightclubs, etc.",
      business: "Many may only attribute Ventrue with financial acumen, but Toreadors own many properties and business on a global scale. Of course unlike the Clan of Kings, many don't do this for money, they do it for the thrill. The chance to mingle with human society, see humans feel real emotions, or just enjoy the thrill of a new venture.",
      feeding: "On a more personal level many Toreadors love experience with herds and retainers. Standout personal assistants, clothing and cars that leave an impression on their herd. Though the Roses also have a tendency to hide their feedings as sensual. The sensation of physical intimacy and feeding is a common vice among the Divas."

      art: "The artist of the clan creates art that conveys the changes in the political scene. Satire a masquerade breacher, having pieces celebrating Kindred victory, or news of a Primogen's scandal hidden in a painting.",
      social: "Many Toreadors are experts at discovering the needs and desires of Kindred. The clan's salons are akin to invite-only venues where those on the guest list doubles as a list of who's who."

    },
    conflicts: "The Camarilla Toreadors and Abstracts often use their minions in contests against each other. Retainers are sent to fight at times, but more often they compete in various battle fields: arts, performance, and other tests of skill. Humans used as pawns in the grand games of the Toreadors in the war of ages is a common sight."
