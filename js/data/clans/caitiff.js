The character begins with the Flaw Suspect (â€¢) and they may not purchase positive status during Character Creation. The Storyteller may impose a 1-2 dice penalty to social tests against Kindred who know they are Caitiff. To improve a Discipline, the cost is 6 times the level of experience points."

  background: {
    description: "Representative of vampires in their purest form, the Caitiff do not suffer from the lineage of their Blood. Due to this, they are usually cast out by their clans either from shame, envy, or fear. The Caitiff take their distance either in shame or pride, born from the unique traits missing from their sire's clan.",
    status: "Their position in Kindred society is the bottom of the rung, after all, only above the Thin-blood who shouldn't have been created at all."

  archetypes: {
    secretCaitiff: "Biding their time, the Caitiff knows that they are not a member of the clan, but has learned the ins and outs of their sire's clan and with great skill replicates the bane or avoids all situations that might show their true nature.",
    unwantedChilde: "There was nothing more than the idea of a strong childe that their sire wanted, but instead they were given a childe without their lineage flowing through their veins. In turn, the Caitiff was cast out, and rejected by those in their clan."

    maldavis: {
      description: "Born Carol Davis, she had a run-in with a man that looked like her late great-uncle Abraham DuSable. The night ended with the Tremere Embracing her, but the Blood failing to take her into the clan.",
      history: "Taken in by Anarchs, she soon counted herself among the Movement. She worked quickly making a name for herself and rivaling former Chicago Prince Lodin. She was secretly backed and manipulated by some Primogen malcontents. She fought bravely and seemingly almost won Chicago, but Lodin made peace with her backers. She was betrayed and defeated by a unified Camarilla. Her closest allies died in an attempt to save her.",
      currentStatus: "She spent decades in depression, but with Kevin Jackson as Prince, she is filled with her old drive. She is ready to guide the Anarchs of Chicago once again."

    embrace: {
      description: "When a Kindred from a clan tries to Embrace there is a small chance something goes wrong, either the nature of the embrace or a mutation of the Blood in their new childe. The Embrace takes, but it doesn't carry on the clan bane or subtle attraction clans have for one another.",
      theories: [
        "Frenzy Embraces",
        "weak human stock",
        "supernatural phenomena"
      ],
      note: "A rumor circulates within Kindred circles that Caitiff are only made this way and the clanless never pursue the embrace, this is absolutely not true. While many Caitiff are a result of the Embrace not passing on the Clan Curse and affinity for Disciplines, Caitiff may decide to Embrace for reasons all their own, continuing the creation of Caitiff."

        "Cultivate large herds to safely feed on without poaching other Kindred lands",

        "Treat their herd and vessels as a tasting ground for new resonances to power their mutable Blood"

    kindredSociety: {
      description: "Caitiff are thought to be an omen of the end times according to the Church of Caine. Many other Kindred view them with distrust and some Caitiff themselves feel they do not belong among the Kindred Clan even if they have the rare sire willing to overlook their condition.",
      socialStatus: "This places the Caitiff at the bottom of the hierarchy right above the Thin-blood.",
      relationships: "Whether it is through a blood-borne impulse, shared identity, or similar experiences, many clans are somewhat drawn to another clan mate to a minute degree, but the Caitiff lack this completely.",
      coteries: "Though Caitiff will still form coteries in order to survive as self preservation is paramount. Many are slow to trust which may strain a coterie, but willing to see where a prospective coterie goes if the other Kindred manage to work with them they can become ardent supporters of the group."

        challenges: "Even while the Caitiff are seemingly praised for their clanless nature, many still feel the sting of ostracism. Unable to relate to the Gangrel, Tzimisce, Brujah, or Minister as they are able to connect with members of their own.",
        status: "The faction too has Caitiff passed over for status, serving on the front line, and pressed to sell out those lower than them for usefulness."

        description: "Some set out to find a place in the Ivory Tower, the Panders are Caitiff who ignore the Tower's years of bias for crumbs of power and status.",
        requirements: "Some domains required sponsors for Caitiff to even be admitted.",
        roles: "The Ivory Tower does see the light when it comes to Caitiff usefulness, often acquiring them as scourges and doers of dirty jobs. These Panders are willing to sink low and attack Thin-bloods either as a scourge or hounds for a bit of status."

      independents: {
        description: "There are many Caitiff who have found Kindred society is a losing game of manipulation and gaslighting.",
        perspective: "These clanless don't have a formal name but are filled with cynicism at being used with false hope by the Movement and like pawn pieces by the Camarilla. They typically call Caitiff that associate with the Movement or Tower 'sellouts.'"
