If they receive any 10's they then take 1 Aggravated damage for each as they are scorched from within. What constitutes as the same place is defined by the chronicle, but generally will need a mile distance between the two resting places before the bane is triggered. Mobile havens do work as long as the haven is moved a mile away. Due to this, the Ravnos may not take the No Haven Flaw."

    description: "Masters of misdirection, the Ravnos prefer not to fight or bleed for something they can obtain through subtler means.

    methods: "Their methods are not usually those of brute force, gaining adoring fans or overdrawn plans that take centuries to complete.

    travelingBlogger: "Maybe blogs haven't been as big as they once were, but they still make a profit and avoid the firery burn from their lineage by documenting the travels they undertake. It's a safe way to spend eternity as long as they maintain their charade that is.",
    hitman: "A rare breed within the Ravnos given the requirements of being a professional hitman. Still, they perform their mission as needed and upon payment they disappear until summoned again.",

When she finished an episode of indulgence she realized many of her clan had disappeared. With another lost family she took to calling her Caitiff, operating as a Mercenary in the Chicago area."
