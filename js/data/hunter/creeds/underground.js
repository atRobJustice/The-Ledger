  personality: "Underground Hunters come from all different backgrounds. Some were merely at the wrong place at the wrong time, and others are so angry all the time that burning down a creature's lair nets a positive outcome. One of the most common personality traits of the Underground Hunter is that they've had enough and have become Hunters to hunt. These Hunters are often broadly skilled, using their determination and desire to solve problems themselves to motivate how they take on life. They could be an optimistic tinkerer, the quickest learner at their job, or a paranoid doomsday prepper. Regardless of their background, they take pride in being able to handle things on their own without needing to call in a specialist. Some Underground Hunters have a cynical eye not just for orgs but also for the social structures that build up the status quo. Whether it's the desire to tear down the support that forces spaces of poverty and desperation that allow monsters to thrive or a desire to use the system against itself with criminal intent, the Underground The Hunter knows nobody is looking out for them except them and their cell.",
  tactics: "The Underground Creed doesn't see much purpose in hurling itself headfirst at unknown enemies, despite it's preference for immediate action. With each night lost giving them a chance to cost lives, they tend to run with light gear. Their tactics include poisoning, break-and-entering, assassinations, and even organized crime, with many more different approaches. They use traps, tricks, and dirty fighting to achieve their goals. Without the superior funding and firepower of orgs they have little choice. They work through improvisation, misdirection, and a lot of proxies and lookouts. Their unorthodox methods can be an advantage, as they are unpredictable and hard to understand because they rarely use codified procedures.",
  dangers: "Due to their knack for immediate action, their lack of long-term planning often leaves them unprepared. Their burst of dedication to the hunt can only save them for so long before they are unable to predict the incoming threats. Many Underground Hunters hit hard when they go after their quarry to enjoy the initial success, but should the quarry survive or have friends... They are often unprepared for the incoming threats. Due to their tendency to strike with overwhelming power once and then have to fight on their heels in defense, they are often the shortest-lived Hunters.",

A contract went sideways, though, and the more they were exposed to the supernatural world, the more they questioned their existence. What was the difference between a blood sucker and a protection racket? Both are still blood suckers."
