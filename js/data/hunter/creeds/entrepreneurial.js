  creedField: "While on the Hunt, develop, create, enhance, or repair.",
  personality: "The Entrepreneurial appeals to those who want greater freedom in how they operate, who are willing to take a risk for the potential reward, and who are inventors. They solve problems using tried-and-true techniques as well as trial and error. Some of these Hunters are more \"mad scientists\" or garage inventors, while others have backgrounds in the military or business with extensive protocols. Those who are resourceful enough have discovered a way to profit from the Hunt. Entrepreneurials who have unveiled the unpleasant truth about the existence of the supernatural may find it fulfilling to use their interests to better the world.",
  tactics: "When the Hunt doesn't entail unknown murderous entities, the Entrepreneurial may go into the fray with the intention of capturing or observing the Quarry rather than killing it. Coming back with a resource that can be subject to experimentation is often part of their nature. This may lead to specialized equipment that can then aid them in conflict or be turned into a replicated product to be sold to recoup costs. Cells with Entrepreneurial members may utilize untested methods while in the field, and in some cases, they may not even know they are being risky. However, improvising is common for Hunters as there's no written playbook that describes how to approach situations. This makes outcomes unpredictable most of the time, especially when they've used the Entrepreneurial's latest invention.",
  dangers: "Hunters face many dangers, but a danger specific to the Entrepreneurial is the loss of their tools, gadgets, and inventions. Something dropped in desperation can lead to their quarry finding the tool. It's not impossible for the supernatural creatures of the night to destroy, understand, or possibly even use them against the Hunter. The danger can quickly shift from the loss of an important tool to something worse as the quarry uses the gadget against the cell. The approach of capturing quarry instead of eradicating them also comes with great risk. This can potentially expose them to the powers of the supernatural, especially those they are unaware of. A destroyed vampire cannot rot the minds of the living, but a vampire caged could certainly make the attempt.",
