  creedField: "While on the Hunt, any direct conflict with the supernatural, be it physical, social, or mental.",
  personality: "The Faithful are often characterized as fire-and-brimstone zealots, but in reality, the Creed is much broader than that. A Faithful could be a temple monk coming out of their cloister to return balance to the natural order in which a supernatural creature has tainted it, or they may be a self-styled \"missionary\" spreading their belief system in a locale that doesn't welcome them. The Faithful Hunters are also those who remain quiet but are relentless in their opposition to the supernatural, acting as a shield instead of a sword against the supernatural world. Faithful Hunters seek out the wrongs in the world that align with their spiritual outlook and set them right. Not every Faithful Hunter is part of the holier-than-thou stereotype as portrayed by their overbearing members. Many are pragmatic, charitable, and have a variety of other traits given by their faith. Many even find themselves being sympathetic towards their quarry, as they assume they became a monster for a reason, and the blame isn't always on the quarry itself.",
  tactics: "Faithful Hunters discover and use True Faith and potent relics more often than other organization types. True Faith and faith are two different things, however, and plenty Faithful Hunters do not have access to them or to the relics themselves. Due to this, many Faithful spend plenty of time researching, observing, or reclaiming relics. Most Faithful act in accordance with their faith, also known as \"by the book\", while on the Hunt. But like all Creeds, there are those who go against the grain. Those who do are likely protected by catechisms that act as a blockage against temptations and other uses of the supernatural. All of this varies, of course, depending on the values and background of the faith in question. One Faithful Hunter may fight in a conventional manner as decreed by their faith, while others utilize guerrilla tactics borne of decades of persecution by oppressive forces.",
  dangers: "A Faithful Hunter may occasionally strive to carry out the goals of a religion or faith-based organization. This is a dangerous choice, as far too often these organizations that claim to represent higher powers have little in common with the perspectives of the faith. In extreme cases, the Faithful Hunter's main goal is to maintain and hold organizational power or cultural dominance, much like an org. However, not all faiths share this, and the most dangerous ones are those that are both the most common faiths in society and the most culturally aggressive ones. The concept of a crisis of faith transcends creeds, but it can weaken a Hunter whose determination is otherwise unwavering.",

      name: "Absolver",
      description: "The Absolver uses rituals as their most potent weapon, even if it's only from their point of view. Each time they meet with a victim of a supernatural creature, even if they are dead, they absolve them of whatever missteps led them to the supernatural creature targeting them. Afterwards, they swear to hunt the creature responsible."

      name: "Death's-brink convert",
      description: "The convert didn't always see a reason for religion, but after a terrible experience of being stalked and hunted by the supernatural, they begged forgiveness for their wayward lives, and it worked to save them from a terrible fate. Since then, they've kept the promise that they made and continue to fight against the supernatural."

      name: "Physical specimen",
      description: "This Hunter practices rigorous forms of ritualistic exercise and has spent their life hunting down remote religious communities to find personal balance and discipline after a troublesome life. One night they overpowered something that was pretending to be one of them; since then they've come to a different perspective, and while some think they are being tested, they believe their deviation to improvement serves a greater purpose."

    {
      name: "Apostate",
      description: "In their years of hunting the supernatural, the Apostate has heard many strange things. Specifically, the bloodsuckers tell themselves they are the monster so that they do not become one. At first, this was weird, but as they aged and became more experienced in the Hunt, they saw some of the truth behind what they thought were originally devilish lies. Now, the Apostate consumes the powers of the supernatural, but at least they are honest with themselves."
