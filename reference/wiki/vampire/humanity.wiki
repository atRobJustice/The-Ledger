The Humanity score represents how close a Kindred remains to their human nature, to specific people vital to them, and how easily they slip away from human concerns and instead towards the whims of the [[beast|Beast]].

__TOC__

==Overview==
Most vampires will begin to drop in Humanity over time with neonates and ancillas sitting around Humanity 5.<ref name=":2">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 238</ref> A vampire player character will start at Humanity 7 unless particular circumstances alter this such as [[predator types|Predator types]]. Those that are freshly [[Embrace|Embraced]] will begin at Humanity 8. Kindred are monsters, regardless of their rating and even the most saintly and highest of Humanity vampires can be morally corrupt. As their Humanity rating changes over the course of time, it's important to keep track of the changes that will occur. As their rating deteriorates over time, their connections alter and soon they might find themselves holding the corpse of a human they had originally never intended to kill.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 236</ref>
