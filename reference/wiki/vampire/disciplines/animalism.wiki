==Overview==
Animalism allows Kindred to communicate with, control, or feed more efficiently on animals. It also lets them act on the inner Beast of other vampires. Although stereotypically used by those who are social outcasts, struggling to fit into mortal society (or simply lacking the interest to), it's not a rule - example being [[Lettow Kaminsky]], [[Gangrel]] Prince of Tucson, Arizona. Their ability to control animals lets them gather information in secret or unleash devastating attacks with their minions. Animalism only works on vertebrates unless the user has [[Animalism#Unliving Hive|Unliving Hive]], which extends the power to swarms of insects. The power is most effective on predators, and in cases where it's being used on herbivores increases the Difficulty of skills rolls by one. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 244-245</ref>  

As example uses, Clan [[Gangrel]] may employ an animal companion using [[Animalism#Bond Famulus|Bond Famulus]], some of which they use for spying on others or attacking victims. Other Gangrel may even turn the pets on their owners using powers such as [[Animalism#Feral Whispers|Feral Whispers]] or [[Animalism#Atavism|Atavism]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 72</ref> To the [[Nosferatu]] Animalism is an incredibly useful tool that allows them to extend their influence in both information gathering and sharing. It also allows them to approach combat in a different way than other Disciplines as they swarm their opponents with hordes of creatures.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 84</ref> With the occasional companion at their side, the [[Ravnos]], are less alone as they travel. They may also utilize animals as spies or distractions when needed.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion ]], page 8</ref> [[Tzimisce]] may use animals to flex their power over their domain.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 18</ref>
