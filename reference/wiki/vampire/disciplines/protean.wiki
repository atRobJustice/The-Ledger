__TOC__

==Overview==
Protean is a power that shapes and mutates the form of the user. This power is employed for its utility above all else, allowing the user to become a beast, turn their limbs into weapons or touch the more animalistic side of their Beast. Small items on the user are affected by this power, however, backpacks and other large items are not. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 269</ref> 

The [[Gangrel]] are perhaps the most mastered with this Discipline, as few possess the gifts. They use their abilities to [[Protean#Shapechange|Shapechange]] in many ways and notably consider feeding this way the best of kills. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 72</ref>[[The Ministry|Ministers]] use this power to extend their monstrous fangs or to take the shape of animals, generally taking the form of a snake over a wolf. However, they still use [[Protean#Earth Meld|Earth Meld]] as the Gangrel do to avoid the sun.<ref name=":03">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 184</ref> [[Tzimisce]] are masters of their form, controlling their shape and appearance at will. With their combined mastery of [[Dominate]], they can manipulate their flesh and that of others with powers such as [[Protean#Fleshcrafting|Fleshcrafting]] and [[Protean#Vicissitude|Vicissitude]]. They also use Protean to shape themselves into other forms such as a bat or wolf.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 18</ref>
