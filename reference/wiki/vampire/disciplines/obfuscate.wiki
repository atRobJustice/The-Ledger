__TOC__

==Overview==
Obfuscate is a power that allows the Kindred to hide easily, move without being noticed, and cast illusions. It gives users the ability to get close to victims or disguise themselves as well as give them an out when a situation gets too complicated. The power itself is not invisibility, instead, it works through mental magic, tricking the mind of others to ignore the kindred presence or see a mundane face instead.     

Unless otherwise stated Obfuscate affects all five senses and coaxes victims to step out of the way to the point of rationalizing to themselves about why they are avoiding that particular corner. However, there are limitations to this power. The power will fail if the victim cannot ignore the user such as being backed into a corner or being blocked from a doorway they wish to walk through. As well as violent actions, loud noises or failed rolls to tamper with items. Without [[Obfuscate#Ghost in the Machine|Ghost in the Machine]], the kindred is easily recognized by machine surveillance. Users of [[Auspex#Sense the Unseen|Sense the Unseen]], are able to roll against these powers, as well as those about to be struck by a sneak attack. Without the use of [[Obfuscate#Vanish|Vanish]], users are unable to use Obfuscate while under observation from others. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 260-261</ref>

The [[Banu Haqim]] stalk prey from the shadows and deliver cloaked judgment to those they feel need it.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 167</ref> Many forget that the [[Malkavian|Malkavians]] possess this ability and use it in a variety of ways, most notably in conjunction with [[Dominate]] to mentally torture their opponents.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 79</ref> Meanwhile, [[The Ministry|Ministers]] use this skill to discover vice or lure victims to a secluded spot and use that information against them. [[Church of Set|Setites]] use obfuscate to mentally tear down opponents known as [[Obfuscate#Mental Maze|Mental Maze]] and [[Presence#True Love's Face|True Love's Face]].<ref name=":03">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 184</ref> The [[Nosferatu]] are most known for mastering this Discipline to remain hidden or disguised while collecting information on others, later to be used against them or sold to others as boons.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 84</ref> Members of the [[Ravnos]] clan are known to utilize this power to conjure illusions called [[Obfuscate#Chimestry|Chimestry]] to shape reality or strike fear into others.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 8</ref>
