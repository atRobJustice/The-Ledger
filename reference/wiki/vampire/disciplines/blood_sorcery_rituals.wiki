==Blood Sorcery Rituals==
Unless otherwise marked all Rituals cost one Rouse Check, five minutes per level to cast, and winning an Intelligence + Blood Sorcery Difficulty (Ritual Level + 1). Rituals that benefit the recipient can only be cast onto the sorcerer themselves unless otherwise stated. Many call for necessary ingredients, but may only require blood and concentration.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 275</ref> Learning new rituals in play take time and experience. Learning  new ritual is at least the square of the its level in weeks.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook|Vampire: the Masquerade Corebook]], page 272</ref>

In the past the best knowledge was out of reach of many in chantries owned by the [[Tremere]] or strong holds connected to [[Banu Haqim|Banu Haqim's]] Alamut. Both clans have faced upheavals, and the arcane secrets are up for grabs. A whole [[Blood craft scene|redworking scene]] has sprung up with desperate kindred of the aforementioned clans looking to find ingredients or knowledge, while other Kindred see an opportunity to learn or profit off this new market. 

Good teacher or a good [[Blood_craft_scene#Tomes_and_Grimoires|grimoire]] may lessen the time needed to learn a ritual. It is possible to create new rituals through an extended test that may take in game months to complete.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 59</ref>
