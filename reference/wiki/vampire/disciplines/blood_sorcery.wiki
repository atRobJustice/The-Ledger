__TOC__

==Overview==
Unlike other Disciplines, Blood Sorcery is a power that does not develop organically, instead, it is developed by being taught or through research of old tomes. It also functions slightly differently in that not only does it give powers per level but it also opens access to [[Blood Sorcery Rituals]] equal or lesser to the user's current Blood Sorcery level. However, ghouls of sorcerers or Thin-Bloods with temporary Disciplines from [[Resonance|Resonances]] do not receive access to these rituals. At creation, if the character has Blood Sorcery they receive one ritual for free, further rituals cost both experience and time. Rituals generally take at least the square of their rating in weeks to learn. The powers on a surface level may appear weaker, but where it shines is in the versatility of the rituals and flexibility as Sorcerers can learn as many rituals as they desire. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 272</ref>  

This power is unique to the [[Tremere]] and [[Banu Haqim]], one which they argue who created it first. "Thaumaturgy", as the Tremere call it, maintains that it was theirs. Whereas the Banu Haqim are dead set on their version, "Quietus", was the origin long before the Tremere were ever a clan. Both approach the learning style differently, with the Tremere originally relying on the Pyramid and its structure to ensure neonates were taught before its collapse, now they seek information on this power through scraps of its remains. Whereas the Banu Haqim stressed the Sire Childe relationship to teach them, however, these nights many Banu Haqim ends up in different places than their sire. The Tremere use their magics to inflict powerful attacks on their opponent's body with powers like [[Blood Sorcery#Scorpion's Touch|Scorpion's Touch]]. Some may even use Thaumaturgy to ease their feeding by drawing their blood into their mouth without touching them by utilizing [[Blood Sorcery#Theft of Vitae|Theft of Vitae]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 97</ref>  In a similar fashion the Banu Haqim use their blood sorcery to turn vitae into poison and use it as a weapon. Harnessing the power for killing is not the only use they have as the viziers delve into rituals to learn secrets from others' blood. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 167</ref>

The Old Clan's Sorcerers point out the Tremere and Banu Haqim are the only innate blood sorcerers, while in the shadows the Setites of [[the Ministry]] practice a form of sorcery they called Akhu.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 94</ref> The [[Tzimisce]] sorcerers call themselves koldun, or kolduny when there's a group of them, and consider themselves the oldest and best blood sorcerers that founded the [[Sabbat|Sabbat’s]] vaulderie practice among other things. These rare few practice a form of Blood Sorcery that enthralls air, water, fire, or earth to them similar in effect to a [[Blood Bond]] during an initiation ritual performed by another Koldun.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 95</ref> This mystical practice of theirs is unique in Blood Sorcery in that it behaves similarly to Oblivion ceremonies requiring Koldunic Sorcery as a prerequisite in order for its connected rituals to work.

Recent events have made blood sorcery more available in modern nights. The [[Second Inquisition]], [[Gehenna|Gehenna War]], [[Anarch|Second Anarch Rebellion]], Fall of the Pyramid, and Fall of Alamut have all played a role in the growth of the black market called the [[blood craft scene]]. Other clans like the [[Toreador]], [[Hecata]], and [[Brujah]] have shown interest in acquiring blood sorcery where in the past only a handful of their members might have had access to its secrets.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 9</ref> While Blood sorcery has gotten much less guarded than it was in the past it is still a long and dangerous path as the remnants of the Pyramid in House Tremere, the Praepositors of the [[Praesidium]], older Banu Haqim, and other threats exist to stamp out the red workers for good.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 93</ref>
