==Overview==
 


Thin-blood Alchemy is a unique Discipline for Thin-bloods, created through ingredients composed of random items, Resonances, and their own vitae. Alchemy is a young Discipline, thought to be born through the street drug scene or of alchemists of the past. Certain thin-bloods have managed to utilize their weak blood to awaken powers unique to them and even create counterfeit versions of the other Disciplines. Rumors spread through kindred about these powers, speculation spreading as much truth as it does misinformation. However, the alchemists do their best to stay out of the way when plenty of elders view this new Discipline as nothing but watered-down diablerie.

All formulae require a cost to distill and then a separate cost to activate which is the same as using other Disciplines (Free or additional Rouse Checks). The cost when creating represents the vitae of the Alchemist being used. Once the power is activated they then roll their distillation pool, defined by which method they use to determine how effective their alchemy is. Some powers might require additional rolls to use, and in cases where a power calls for a Discipline rating, they use their Alchemy Rating instead. Learning further formulae has the Alchemist's pouring through old libraries or going on tasting expeditions to learn more. A character receives one formulae for free for each dot in Thin-Blood Alchemy and more can be purchased with experience and experimentation. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 282-283</ref>

Distillation methods vary from Alchemist to Alchemist, when they first begin they select which style they'd like. To learn additional styles, later on, means treating it as a separate Discipline where each formula needs to be learned or relearned in order to be used in the new style. The three styles are '''Athanor Corporis''', '''Calcinatio''' and '''Fixatio'''. 

* '''Athanor Corporis''' is the name for alchemy created through their own body by consuming the ingredients they make a distillation roll of Stamina + Alchemy together with a Rouse Check. Only one power can be activated at a time and a new power must be distilled before being activated. Distillation takes around three turns of concentrations where the Alchemist can do nothing else. <ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 284</ref>

* '''Calcinatio''' is the method where a human body is used to host the alchemy by introductions of incantations and their own blood. The alchemist feeds their vitae to the mortal and makes a Rouse Check,  then a distillation roll of Manipulation + Alchemy. The entire host distills the formula and the blood of the mortal can be drunk to use the power, where the hunger slaked is equal to the power level minus 1. However, they can only distill one power per victim and the current power remains as long as they are kept in the same emotional state. Each power takes as long to activate as it takes to slake the amount of blood required. <ref name=":0" />

* '''Fixatio''' is the final method, in a style similar to what most think of when they think of Alchemy. In a kiln, a meth lab, or a repurposed propane tank, the alchemist uses a conventional athanor to brew. They pour their vitae with a Rouse Check into the system with the other ingredients, then makes the distillation roll with Intelligence + Alchemy (Make the distillation roll upon use rather than upon production). The resulting formula is then able to be carried with the amount carried equal to their Wits or Dexterity. They can store a number of formulae equal to Alchemy rating * 2 plus the haven rating. Creating their alchemy requires a lab and without one they at best can only create a level 3 or less formula, and using unsuitable equipment reduces their distillation dice pool by 2. They can activate one power per turn. <ref name=":0" />
