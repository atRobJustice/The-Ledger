'''Tremere''' are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The arcane Clan Tremere were once a house of mortal mages who sought immortality but found only undeath. As vampires, theyâ€™ve perfected ways to bend their own Blood to their will, employing their sorceries to master and ensorcel both the mortal and vampire world. Their power makes them valuable, but few vampires trust their scheming ways.<ref>[https://www.worldofdarkness.com/vampire-the-masquerade-clans Vampire: The Masquerade Clans section], World of Darkness Website</ref> 

== Disciplines ==
Below are the powers innate to the Tremere as well as the uses they find in it.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 97</ref>
*'''Auspex''' allows the Tremere to perceive the truth from their surroundings, hunting down hidden objects and communicate long distances with others without fear of being heard. When in a pinch they use this power to find a pliable victim to feed from.
*'''Dominate''' gives the Warlocks the ability to do anything for knowledge and get away with it. Theft, betrayal, and anything else with lesser ethics are easily covered by manipulating the minds of others. They show little remorse when using this power to feed as well when needed.
*'''Blood Sorcery''' grants them the ability to release devastating attacks against their foes, protecting themselves in turn and ease feeding. Some Thaumaturgy uses this power to sap the blood from a mortal's body without physical touch. This expertise in unlocking the secrets of blood makes them a valued if not mistrusted member of the Camarilla.

== Bane ==
<section begin="bane" />'''Deficient Blood''' - Before the fall of Vienna, they were defined by their rigid hierarchy of Blood Bonds within the Pyramid. After the fall, their Blood weakened and rejected all prior connections. Tremere are unable to Blood Bond other Kindred, though they can still be Bound by other clans. Tremere can still Blood Bond mortals to do their bidding, but their corrupted vitae must be drunk an additional amount of times equal to their Bane Severity.<section end="bane" /><ref name=":0" />

==Variant Bane==
<section begin="altbane" />'''Stolen Blood''' -
When performing a Blood Surge they need to make Rouse Checks equal to their Bane Severity. If these Rouse Checks increase their Hunger to 5 or higher, they can choose whether to back off their Blood Surge or perform it to then hit Hunger 5 afterward immediately.<section end="altbane" /><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], page 59</ref>

== Compulsion ==
<section begin="compulsion" />'''Perfectionism''' - Nothing but the best will satisfy them, anything less than exceptional still instills a profound sense of failure. When afflicted by this, the Warlock suffers a two-dice penalty to all dice pools. The penalty is reduced to one die when actions are being repeated and removed entirely on a second repeat. This does not end till they managed to score a critical win on a Skill roll or the scene ends.<section end="compulsion" /><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 210</ref>

== Example archetypes ==
*'''Determined Scholar''' - Their desire for power is never quenched as they undertake any task regardless of its peril to seek out scraps of information.
*'''Witchcraft Expert''' - Embraced for their skill in mortal occult, this knowledge has only grown as the Kindred attempts to push their Blood Sorcery beyond its normal limits.
*'''Eternal Detective''' - While knowledge is their goal, they find helping others unravel their mysteries to be their true purpose. Perhaps a detective once in life, they now run their own business to continue to work for other Kindred.
*'''Niche Podcaster''' - When other Kindred may prefer to hide in the shadows, this Kindred works to build a cult of personality online. Dabbling in their dark arts using the mortals who have shown true devotion to them.
== Notable characters ==
'''Carna''' - She was once the Prince of Marseilles and the Primogen of Milwaukee and now has her own splinter cell of Tremere called the House of Carna. Her group advocates for the freedom from the Blood Bond against the Pyramid's tyranny and the misogyny of the clan itself. When the Pyramid planned to eradicate Carna, it was raided by the Second Inquisition at the Great Chantry.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 285</ref>

'''Karl Schrekt''' - Former Justicar who was a legend within his own clan and the Camarilla. Before his embrace in 1235, he hunted vampires and for centuries after that he acted as the tower's weapon against the Sabbat and Anarchs or other menaces. He hid or destroyed information regarding the Antediluvians. For as many Disciplines as he gained and as few enemies that survived, he's now one of the eldest Tremere remaining.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]] , page 405</ref>

'''Aisling Sturbridge''' - The New York-based High Regent of the Chantry of the Five Boroughs. She oversee research, operations, tutelage, and safety of the chantries. She appears in [[Vampire: The Masquerade Coteries of New York|Coteries of New York]], [[Vampire: The Masquerade Shadows of New York|Shadows of New York]], and [[NY by Night|New York by Night]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 143</ref>

'''Meerlinda''' - One of the founders of the clan, she has been missing since the attack on the Vienna Chantry by the [[Second Inquisition]]. However, the [[Praesidium]] believes that she is still alive, and either in torpor or captured somewhere in Krakow, Rome or Moscow.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Forbidden Religions]], page 25</ref>

== Culture ==

=== History ===
Tremere was once the name of an eight-century Romanian hermetic mage, obsessed with knowledge and power. This obsession allowed him to prolong his lifespan beyond the mortal timeframe, but eventually, his power weakened, and in turn, he became unwilling to accept his mortality. From his greed, he instigated terrifying magical experiments which damned him and his followers. Thousands of mortals and hundreds of Kindreds were murdered in the experimentation and ritualistic practices to find the elixir of life. These actions eventually unveiled the curse of Caine, entering him and his followers into an eternity of unlife and hunger, unable to use practice their craft. Tremere and followers were able to use [[Blood Sorcery]] to imitate their old magic and organized their newly turned clan. The Tremere were once possibly the most organized clan by virtue of their Pyramid, a strict hierarchy with the [[Blood Bond]] and oaths enforcing loyalty so power was concentrated at the top and trickled down. They had ranks and chantries who all answered to the Council of Seven, who sat atop the Pyramid.

In 2008 the Prime Chantry in Vienna was destroyed by the [[Second Inquisition]], and their ability to Blood Bond dissolved, it knocked them from their powerful status to unwelcome Kindred. The Usurpers had few friends from the arrogance of their Pyramid, still, the need for their Blood Sorcery hasn't disappeared. Without the Pyramid, the Tremere lack the structure and organization they once had, now competing with other Kindred and their clan to claim a foothold and regain some of their former glory. Their desire to collect the remains from the Chantry rival the ugliness seen within the Camarilla and is often used as a weapon between the remaining Tremere houses. 

The remaining Warlocks serve in three ways; either to other clans with their occult knowledge, the Camarilla with Blood Sorcery, or, themselves to grasp at power. Even if they've shifted more towards the practice of their art rather than the theory of it, they still claim fewer thrones than the [[Nosferatu]]. The reality is that most do not see a need to become Prince unless it serves to further their knowledge as to most, power is the knowledge of how to shape the world to their will and access to the rarest of ancient artifacts. Misguided by their greed for knowledge, most keep their secrets hidden from their coteries and even their clanmates. However, Kindred seeking knowledge of their history will do well to approach the Tremere for answers. As long as they are at peace with knowing that they'll need to share some of their secrets, knowingly or not.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 93-95</ref><ref name=":1">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 189</ref> Many warlocks are active on the [[blood craft scene]], searching for knowledge, scrounging for ingredients, or leveraging their blood sorcery for profit. Some seek what was lost and other seek to build something new.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 99</ref> 

=== Houses ===
Though the Tremere have fractured into factions, there are three that strive to have some sense of overall clan unity: House Carna, House Goratrix, and House Tremere. This does not eliminate their rivalry with one another nor the smaller factions and Tremere mercenaries who want to go their own path.<ref name=":2">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 140</ref>

==== House Tremere ====
The main house of Clan Tremere is led by Karl Schrekt. They remain aligned to the Camarilla sect and loyal to the Pyramid with their traditions.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 94</ref> They are still secretive with their knowledge and have high standards for embrace. They usually embrace from Intellectuals, academia, occultists, and whoever they believe are worthy of the Blood. This House keeps the previous organization with standardized feeding practices and even a new Council of Seven. Under each Council member are seven Pontifex who oversee wider operations of a specific field. Head of Chantry is a Regent under them are the apprentices.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" />  The [[Praesidium]] is a militant sub-faction and cultÂ  within House Tremere who work to undermine the other major houses and and House Ipsissimus with aims to restore the Pyramid.<ref name=":3">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Forbidden Religions]], page 24-29</ref>

==== House Carna ====
Followers  of Carna may also be called Witches, Blood Witches, or Carnines.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 16</ref>  A splinter cell created by Carna herself looking to separate herself and her followers from the Blood Bonds of the Pyramid. After the fall of the Pyramid, this group attracts many Anarchs and disenfranchised Camarilla members. In the modern age, she pushes for the modernization and feminization of Clan Tremere. While they are officially Camarilla aligned, they do have [[Anarch]] leanings. Those embraced in this house are usually unorthodox by old Pyramid standards: pagans, psychics, and chaos magicians. The House serves a cult of personality as a kink-forward, blood bond-like ritual ties the participants to Carna.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 385</ref> <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 95</ref> Their mission is to expand the research on Blood Sorcery. To this end, the Witches have explored Thin-Blood Alchemy, mortal Wiccans, and reach for a new unified theory of magic. The House hazards angering other supernatural creatureâ€™s with their meddling, but they have found some successes that push their pursuit on.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 102-103</ref>

==== House Goratrix ====
A cultish Tremere house lead by Goratrix and previously apart of the Sabbat, joining the Camarilla in modern nights.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 94</ref> Followers are called Goratricine, Goratrero in South America, and Goratajo disdainfully by outsiders. They are sometimes called traditionalists by other blood sorcerers. The one giving directives to their followers is assumed to Goratrix or someone skillful in Blood sorcery. The structure currently has breaks in communication, but this house aims to rebuild the Pyramid using Dominate, Presence, and strict obedience in absence of Blood Bonds. They are willing to buy nearly anything for their goal. They spread influence through occult favor, pulling old court debts, and recruiting new warlocks with seemingly promising terms. Once in the House it becomes apparent they micromanage their membersâ€™ unlives: be it feeding, finances, or whatever in name of chantry good. The overbearing nature of this house scares many would be recruits away. They must make calculated shows of strength to prove their legitimacy.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 101-102</ref>

==== House Ipsissimus ====
A faction the Tremere, existing within the [[Anarch]] sect after the fall of the Pyramid. Now free from their bonds of enslavement, they strive to find perfect balance in all things in order to reach enlightenment.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 170</ref> Now free from their bonds of enslavement, they strive to find perfect balance in all things in order to reach enlightenment. They are a well known example Solitarchies keeping to street level politics or marketeers for new magic. Though their presents and persistence in the Anarchs make them a House of notices, especially by the Presidium.<ref name=":5">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 103</ref><ref name=":3" />

==== Solitarchies ====
Any other Tremere chantry that operates outside of one of the three major Houses regardless of sect.<ref name=":4" /> When the Prime Chantry fell, some chantry leaders continued to operate, having the foresight to not solely rely on the blood bond for loyalty. These Tremere enclaves develop either by choice or through necessity of losing their main body. Some have even fallen into more radical organizations and research topics without the Pyramid leaders to give them directives or monitor their research.<ref name=":5" />
