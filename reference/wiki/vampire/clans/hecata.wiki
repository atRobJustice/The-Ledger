== Background ==
'''Hecata''' are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. A motley collection of necromantic vampire bloodlines, the Hecata clan are united in the pursuit of a single subject: Death. They are students of the afterlife and resurrectionists of the dead — or worse. Selling their services to the highest bidder, or acting in their own interests, there are few who can hide from the surveillance of those who can summon and command the very spirits of the deceased.<ref>[https://www.worldofdarkness.com/vampire-the-masquerade-clans Vampire: The Masquerade Clans section], World of Darkness Website</ref>   

A clan steeped in death, they practice the arts of necromancy and communication with the dead. The clan tends to favour mortals either from their own mortal family or those with useful connections to other outside families. It is speculated that the reason all Hecata share the same Disciplines unlike their ancestors is caused by the unification of the necromantic bloodlines that formed clan Hecata and the destruction of so many Giovanni elders.    

At Storytellers discretion, a few changes to the Discipline line up may be made depending on the character's bloodline either through replacement of a power with another or by offering a unique 4-dot merit to unlock a fourth in-clan discipline. The following changes may be made; Giovanni line may replace Auspex with Dominate, Samedi may replace Auspex with Obfuscate, Lamiae may replace Auspex with Potence and the Nagaraja may replace Fortitude with Dominate. Keep in mind the requirements for certain [[Disciplines#Amalgams|Amalgams]] should a player want them.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 200-202</ref>   

With the nature of their bane, the Hecata have developed methods to feed safely. Through blood bags and corpses or extracting blood from their victims without the use of their fangs. They have a habit of feeding on herds or from members of their own family, however this brings strife as resentment and fear builds between them. In more recent years, the clan has formed a unique bond with the [[Circulatory System]], to obtain mute or comatose vessels. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 203</ref>

He turned to his native England when he heard of the ancient Kindred Mithras' presence. The two grew close becoming his Seneschal and secret lover. When the Giovanni began to hunt members of the bloodline, he used powerful necromancy to fake his death. He took on a new identity, Pater Thomas, to lead the cult of Mithras from London to Edinburgh. After being used as bait to seemingly end Mithras, Roger's identity has been revealed. Currently the elder has joined the Hecata, rules Edinburgh as Prince, and runs the Cult of Mithras as he waits for the [[Ventrue]] to return.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Trails of Ash and Bone]], page 143</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Trails of Ash and Bone]], page 171</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Fall of London]], pages 196-198</ref>

He led family in a campaign to expand, collect spirits, and destroy the old Clan of Death. Soon discontent with his rule led to a revolt the has supposedly led to his Final Death or exile. The Giovanni now helped form the Hecata, with bloodline he once wanted destroyed.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 126</ref>

They lead a faction to help carry out their work.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 10 </ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 257</ref><ref name=":1">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Gehenna War]], page 121</ref>
== Culture ==

=== Embrace ===
The clan tends to favor mortals either from their own mortal family or those with useful connections outside of the families. There is a preference for those able to withstand death, either through mortals who have faced it dead on or caused it. As well as those who worked in the fields of medical or occult. Little need is found in those who hold compassion or empathy unless used to close a gap in the clan. Graverobbers embrace those willing to do whatever it takes for the good of their family or community. To them, family comes first even if you are not a Giovanni by name. It is seen as giving the most exceptional person the most exclusive family houses.

Spontaneous embraces are generally frowned upon, as they tend to prefer a more ritualistic approach of watching and grooming would be childer before casting their opinion on their worthiness. Each new addition is usually carefully selected and adds something to the clan, with them seeking to serve the family and expand its interest. With no other true independents in these nights, the Hecata are alone against everyone else.

Criminal kingpins, the self motivated, those who have seen death, occultists, medical professionals, all have things that can attract any branch of the Hecata and sees them as candidates for Embrace. Knowledge of death is also sought after, those with academic, scientific, or religious experience in death or the afterlife are approached. Of course criminals are appealing, from con artists, to professional killers, to crooked money launderers all do much to pique the interest of the clan. Fledglings and neonates usually take to expand the family’s interest or research new mysteries into the cycle of life and death.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], pages 200-201</ref>

=== Structure ===
The Hecata have adapted the Giovanni structure, but largely names, ranks and organization depends on families and culture on a local level of each domain. Unlike the Camarilla, the Hecata usually focus over areas of expertise rather than praxis or location.<ref name=":2">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 143</ref>

==== The Anziani Council ====
The ruling body of the organization who set policy and goals for the Hecata. They convene in a place called the Mausoleum in Venice. In modern night, they are composed of the most influential and brilliant necromancer. The Anziani is the collective name for the many groups within that allow the Hecata to function on an international scale. Hecata members tend to call getting the Anziani’s notice and rising in rank “climbing the Venetian Ladder” as they tend to aim to be in the upper echelons of the family.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 146</ref>

==== 1444 Chamber ====
This inner council used to be Augustus Giovanni’s most powerful advisors. Currently they are the leaders of the clan and who sponsored both the Family Reunion and Capuchin upon their growing frustration with Augustus management. Most old Giovanni loyal to Augustus were destroyed and replaced by new members either talents from the Family or a powerful member of a newly joined bloodline. The members are mysterious, but they are the final arbiters of the Hecata.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 143-146</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Forbidden Religions|Vampire: the Masquerade Forbidden Religions]], page 88</ref>

=== Outside the Reunion ===
There are some bloodlines who are indifferent or have rejected the Family Reunion. They may act as free agents or even hostile to the Hecata.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" />

==== Mora’s Death Seers ====
This group still hold their cousins still responsible for past crimes. A faction of Harbingers led by Mora. The group seeks to travel the world and end the Giovanni bloodline and destroy Hecata of note. Mora claims to have the backing of a methuselah called Unre. The Clan of Death does their best to suppress actions and knowledge of his faction and others like it.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Gehenna War|Vampire: the Masquerade Gehenna War]], page 120-121</ref>

== History ==

=== Original Clan of Death ===
The Cappadocians were the original holders of the title Clan of Death. Cappadocius was the clan founder and leader. They were known for their roles as advisors, scholars, and saboteurs with lamia as a branch family who operated as bodyguards. The Cappadocians had long been allies with [[Ventrue]] and other founding Camarilla clans. In 1444 the Cappadocians inducted the Giovanni into the clan to expand their influence. The Giovanni were known as a family of Venetian merchants and necromancers whose craft trace back to Roman times, when they were known as Jovians. At a certain point Cappadocius locked a portion of the clan he considered failures away under Kaymakli, to seal them forever, this event is known as the Feast of the Folly. Some Cappadocians didn’t heed the invitation and others escaped by traveling into the Underworld led by Capuchin. Those who survive the latter had their faces marred by their time in the Shadowlands becoming Harbingers bloodline, sometimes called Harbingers of the Skull.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 135</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 127</ref> 

=== Rise of Giovanni ===
The Giovanni upon seeing the antedullvian’s actions grew nervous and plotted a coup. This branch soon had their leader, Augustus Giovanni, destroy Cappadocius and lead to the newly formed Clan Giovanni. Their first act was purging the Cappadocians and destroying their Lamia protectors. Many surviving Cappadocians and Harbingers went to the Camarilla for help, but were shocked when the fledgling Camarilla cut a deal with the Giovanni. Camarilla not wanting a two front war with the Giovanni and Sabbat, the Camarilla brokered a deal. The Giovanni were fully seen as the new Clan of Death with the Promise of 1528 signed between Clan Giovanni and the Camarilla. The Promise declared non-aggression and allowed the Giovanni to continue their hunt for Cappadocians. Augustus' grand plan was called Endless Night, a goal to tear down the barrier between the world of the living and the Underworld.<ref name=":0" /><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 231</ref>

Some Harbingers fled to the Sabbat to punish the Giovanni and Camarilla, others retreated back to the Underworld. The many of the surviving Cappadocians who didn’t attend the Feast of the Folly, simply went into hiding and kept low profiles.<ref name=":3">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 128-129</ref> The Giovanni held on to their newfound control by fortifying themselves and spreading their influence; the Giovanni had supposedly succeeded in slaying all of the Lamia at this time. The Giovanni started to embrace other prominent families to enrich the clan: the Rosellini in the 16th century, then the Sicilian-based Puttancesca, then the Dunsirn, Milliners, and others, each provided a useful connection in either finances, politics or dark arts and a foot hold on most of the continents around the world.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 144</ref> 

During the Haitian Revolution a vodou secret society appealed to their gods for power and met a powerful being, others say they captured a vampire; either case the Samedi or Nasyon San an, as they call themselves, were born. They are led by master necromancer, Doc San, often mistaken for Baron Samedi by outsiders. Their influence spread in the Caribbean and often worked with [[The Ministry|Ministry]] vampires.<ref name=":3" /><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods|Vampire: the Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 222</ref>

=== The Family Reunion ===
In the modern night the Harbingers, Cappadocians, Nasyon san an, and dissidents of other death bloodlines started secret communication with young disenfranchised or frustrated Giovanni members. The rumor that the Promise of 1528 was only a 500 year agreement  further led to worry over Camarilla retaliation and Augustus' poor management. This led to an attack on Augustus and his Venetian holdings snowballing into a revolt against the elders of Clan Giovanni, and assassinations of high profile clan members. Some rumor speak of the successful assassinated Augustus Giovanni, others say Augustus is perpetually on the run. An unforeseen consequence was all the ghosts under Augustus’ thrall were released. The Giovanni and all the bloodlines found themself besieged with legions of ghosts that have been enslaved for centuries.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 128-137</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 228</ref>

This led to the formation of the Hecata, a tenuous alliance, often called the Family Reunion. Capuchin became a very prominent leader; The Anziani Council is what sets the clan directives with their inner group, 1444 Chamber, being the mysterious, most prominent council who are the final judges of clan matters. On local levels the Hecata push to increase their influence, solidify this alliance of bloodlines, and deepen their influence of death.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 145-146</ref>
