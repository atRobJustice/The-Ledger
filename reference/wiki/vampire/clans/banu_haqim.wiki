== General ==
'''Banu Haqim''' are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Judges of the Banu Haqim are torn between their hereditary thirst for vampiric Blood and their passion for justice. Stern adjudicators, they are fiercely devoted to upholding a moral code, and [[Embrace]] mortals capable of assessing and handling threats, enforcing laws and traditions, and punishing transgressors.<ref>[https://www.worldofdarkness.com/vampire-the-masquerade-clans Vampire: The Masquerade Clans section], World of Darkness Website</ref>

Regardless of the individual Banu Haqim's stance, they all adhere to some type of strict code, be it blood laws, personal ethics, governmental or religious rules. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean they are free of self-interest, and often such codes of conduct are a self-regulation method to keep in check their desire for Kindred blood. The Banu Haqim's instinct to find the guilty is intrinsic to the Blood and not bound by religion; those guilty of whatever transgression a Child of Haqim deems unforgivable must be punished, and punishment might even include taking their unlife from their veins through diablerie. They are also not tied to a specific cultural or geographical background, and modern Banu Haqim hail from all over the world, representing various beliefs. Their individual code is also not necessarily tied to a faith, and may come from personal convictions rather than religion.<ref name=":1">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], pages 161</ref>
== Disciplines ==
Below are the powers innate to the Banu Haqim and their uses. <ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 167</ref>
*'''Blood Sorcery''' is used to poison their blades and use their blood as a weapon against others, as well as sift out the truth in blood. They keep their secrets of Blood Sorcery close.
*'''Celerity''' gives them to ability to move and react more quickly than humanly possible, allowing them to make judgement calls without the hesitation of thought.
*'''Obfuscate''' is how they melt into shadows and disappear when needed. An useful Discipline for those times when they wish to witness a crime without being spotted before casting their judgement.

== Bane ==
<section begin="bane" />'''Blood Addiction''' - When the Banu Haqim slakes at least one Hunger level from another vampire, they must make a Hunger [[Frenzy]] test at difficulty 2 plus Bane Severity. If they fail, they must gorge themselves on vitae, in turn opening the door to possible [[Diablerie]].<section end="bane" /><ref name=":0" />

== Variant Bane ==
<section begin="altbane" />'''Noxious Blood''' - The Blood of the Banu Haqim is toxic to mortals, but not to other vampires. Due to this mortals receive Aggravated Damage equal to the Bane Severity of the vampire for each Rouse Check’s worth of Blood consumed. Their Blood cannot be used to heal mortal injuries. In amounts below the amount needed to [[Blood Bond]], it does not harm them, even if directly injected into them.<section end="altbane" /><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], page 56</ref>

== Compulsion ==
<section begin="compulsion" />'''Judgement''' - Urged to punish a wrongdoer, the vampire must slake one Hunger from anyone that acts against their own Convictions. Failing to do so results in a three-dice penalty to all rolls until the Compulsion is satisfied or the scene ends. Should the victim be a vampire, the Bane applies.<section end="compulsion" /><ref name=":0" />

== Example archetypes ==
*'''Advocate''' - A lawyer with a strong sense of justice, willing to bring it to those in need, who often used to work on unwinnable cases and represented the most downtrodden clients.
*'''Local Sheriff''' - A guardian for a limited environment, like a small town or a district, with the need to protect it from any potential harm.
*'''Hitman''' - Unrelenting in their task, the hitman is able to meet their goals and beyond. Their creed sometimes pushes them to take additional contracts for personal reasons.
*'''Rehab Leader''' - Their personal life has shaped their ethos, urging them to aid those who seek it and strike out against those who will not seek rehabilitation.
== Notable characters ==
'''Fatima al-Faqadi''' - Known within the clan as the Hand of Vengeance, she was embraced in the 12th Century C.E. and is one of the most dangerous and skilled assassins to ever have become a Kindred. She is faithful to Islam and an enemy to the cultists of Ur-Shulgi. Before Alamut fell under cultist control, she worked for vitae and undertook contracts to benefit the stronghold. Now, she is reported to have become a leader of a Banu Haqim group fighting side by side with the Camarilla in the Gehenna war. Rumor has it she only takes part in these fights to determine the fate of her lover Lucita, though she silences these rumors with a cold deadly stare. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 185</ref>

'''Tegyrius''' - High ranking Vizier of the Ashirra, the groom in the Vermillion Wedding. He is to married and Blood Bound to Victoria Ash in a Blood Wedding to bring both clans together and aid in the Banu Haqim's entry into the Camarilla.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], pages 92-93</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 123</ref>

'''Ur-Shulgi''' - A methuselah of the clan, potentially direct a childe of Haqim, and perhaps one of the greatest sorcerers in the clan. Having awaken from Torpor after thousands of years, broke the clan blood curse, but  was horrified to find his clan follow a human religion. He now leads a schism in his clan with his cult claiming to be the true followers of Haqim at odds with those who follow human religions or challenge his claims.<ref name=":1" />

'''Al-Ashrad''' - The ''Amr,'' the most learned and respected of the clan's sorcerers'','' of the Banu Haqim. Al-Ashrad helped lead many of his clan into the Camarilla after the awakening of Ur-Shulgi as part of the schism in the clan.

== Culture ==

=== Embrace ===
The clan itself is diverse, consisting of many different types of lawmen, scholars, judges, and vigilantes. Sires generally seek to embrace those that excel in strategy and thought as well as honed swords. In more recent nights, they target mortals capable of handling threats, enforcing laws or other traditions through force of personality or skill. It is not uncommon for them to seek out war veterans for their abilities and for a chance at redemption. The Banu Haqim are still more than a clan of murderers. The Viziers and Warriors of the clan have descended from different broods, each compelled to embrace a mortal matching their different inclinations. The Warriors tend towards those skilled in combat and the Viziers seek those knowledgeable in political or legal power. <ref name=":1" />

=== Mortal society ===
Many rumors float around the Banu Haqim, a popular one around Kindred is the notion of the Banu Haqim being only mercenaries with a taste for vitae and never meddle in human affairs. Lawmakers and criminals are a prime sector the clan holds their influence. With the wealthy families of Arabia the clan has infiltrated and manipulated have yielded them many connections: petrochemicals for money making, banks for financial espionage, telecommunications to better encrypt messages, and luxury hotels for exclusivity and more money making. 

Many Banu Haqim look upon their founder as the judge of all vampires. They tend to follow this ideal in how they select their tools and thralls. Their retainers and herd members are often chosen from police departments, private security, and other law enforcement areas and enterprises. Many also select mortals from organized crime for their entourage. They reach into these sectors pragmatically, some of these criminals and officers will get the Embrace, but mostly as valuable assets to hold on to. When there is need for discretion and a mortal to be silenced, the Banu Haqim exert their influence over their mortals to do so.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 161-162</ref>

=== Kindred society ===
The clan is currently recovering from a large schism in their ranks. This crisis has put the [[Camarilla#The Ashirra|Ashirra]] and the clan in a rough spot politically, making the [[Camarilla]] look more appealing. A union with the Camarilla was more desirable than ever. The [[Gangrel]] and [[Brujah]] departure made a niche for protectors and hunters the clan was fit for. Though there was always the mutual enmity with the Tremere, two other events helped secure their place: Vienna’s attack and Sabbat Gehenna War. The [[Ventrue]] and [[Tremere]] may still eye them warily. However, many Kindred of [[Toreador|Clan Toreador]] welcome the newcomers as they are now linked via the Vermillion Wedding, the diplomatic Blood Wedding of Victoria Ash and Tegyrius.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 92</ref>

In the past the clan had many mercenaries, hired killers, and bounty hunters. For a fee of vitae, an enemy Kindred would meet [[final death]]. Now their role has changed, with the Followers of Ur-Shulgi inspiring many to break the ways of old. Their dominance of the law and law breakers has made them ideal members as a pillar of the Camarilla.

The Banu Haqim are known as the Judges, their blood calls forth passion for some form of justice. Many believe in a strict code: the tenants of a cult, personal code of honor, rules of a nation, rules of a religion, or any sort of rules the Haqimite lives by.  Of course cynical Kindred points out this is just the clan hiding their thirst for diablerie behind determining what’s right and wrong. For if someone is guilty, then they deserve to be drained.

Clan culture usually emphasizes childe-sire relationships for mentorship in their blood sorcery ways, though the diaspora of the clan in recent nights has made this challenging.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 272</ref> This type of clan culture rewards achievement and rewards the goal-oriented Haqimites. Stark contrast to some clans that exalt lineage or tradition, the Banu Haqim focus more on deed. This pushes many Banu Haqim to be pragmatic and know when to make allies to fit their personal agenda. Coteries with all Banu Haqim usually have a clear focus and purpose, with the Judge keeping the goal in mind.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 158-163</ref>

In mixed coteries, Banu Haqim may find themselves drawn to setting the plan and focus of the coterie and pushing their coterie mates forward. They usually gravitate toward roles where they can determine group direction or interpret collective goals. They attempt to be leaders though other clans may chafe under such directions. The latter point is true of younger Kindred who are not looking for such a task-oriented coterie.

At times the Haqimite may only be in the coterie until the task is complete. Their pursuit of their agenda’s goals may lead some Banu Haqim to join a different coterie when their old objective is complete. Though they keep former coterie mates as valuable allies and associates. Many Haqimites are always on the move from one coterie to another chasing their goals.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 21</ref>

Some on the [[Blood craft scene|redwork scene]] see the Banu Haqim in three archetypes: judge, scholar, or bouncer. Judges are Banu with strict personal codes or pretend to have them, scholars are looking to learn history or craft, and the bouncer enjoys applied physical arts of Blood Sorcery.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 16</ref> 

== History ==
For a long time, the Banu Haqim have kept themselves removed from Kindred society, but this era of isolation is coming to an end. Somewhere in Afghanistan, the Children of Haqim hide within a base called Alamut. However, this base of operation has fallen to blood cultists, the followers of the now awakened methuselah Ur-Shulgi who prepare to deliver judgement upon their kin known as the [[Shepherds of Ur-Shulgi]]. These cultists are separate from the Islamic Warriors and Viziers embraced long after the clan abandoned their blood worship. Sensible Haqimites are thus pushed to flee their old home. The majority of them have joined the [[Camarilla#The Ashirra|Ashirra]], a local Kindred sect, while the rest seek asylum in the western counterpart - the [[Camarilla]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], pages 160-161</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Forbidden Religions]], pages 19-23</ref>

The changes of their clan have brought the Banu Haqim closer to Kindred society. With old strongholds gone and mingling more, the many Haqimites are on the [[blood craft scene]] dealing blood magic, services, and secrets out of necessity. Though when it comes to teaching, some their individual moral codes somewhat influence how they do business and whom they deal with. Many young scholarly Banu Haqim have taken to the role of chroniclers, researchers, and revivalists on the blood craft scene. Some even use this knowledge for power as ambassadors, leaders, or even regulators.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Blood Sigils|Vampire: the Masquerade Blood Sigils]], page 104-105</ref>

=== Factional differences ===
The Odense Pact was signed in the Danish city of the same name and led to the Banu Haqim being admitted into the Camarilla. Now the Clan is mostly in the Camarilla and the allied Ashirra. While there are no naming differences most of the clan resides in either of the two aforementioned sects. Anarchs and Autarkis of the clan would have usually have to forgo the closeness the clan usually has. Of course, the Shepherds of Ur-Shulgi could be considered Autarkis.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 158</ref>
