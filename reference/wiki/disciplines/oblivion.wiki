__TOC__

== Overview ==
Oblivion is a power rarely used by those outside of the [[Hecata]] and [[Lasombra]]. The power itself extends into two different styles, one focusing on the more ceremonial and necromancy side as seen with the Hecata and the other reaching into the darkness to utilize shadows as seen with the Lasombra. The power itself originates from a plane of death and nothingness, letting its users reach into it and touch something more supernatural than not.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Chicago by Night]], page 292-293 and [[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 203-204</ref>  

Similar to [[Blood Sorcery]], the possession of Oblivion gives access to [[Oblivion Ceremonies]]. Ceremonies all require pre-requisite powers from the Oblivion branch which alters it from Blood Sorcery. Still, ghouls of Necromancers or Thin-bloods gaining temporary access through Resonance do not have access to Ceremonies and only to Oblivion powers. At creation a character may take 1 Oblivion Ceremony should they have at least one dot of Oblivion and the pre-requisite power. Characters can later obtain more Ceremonies at the cost of experience and time. Ceremonies generally take at least the square rating in weeks to learn as well as a teacher who already knows the Ceremony. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 208</ref> 

Oblivion projects a two-dimensional shadow against the three-dimensional world in which we live, making most attacks against them futile as bullets ricochet off the surface rather than the shadow itself. These projections and spirits take damage from bright, direct lights and may be damaged by blessed weapons depending on various factors. A well-lit room is a danger to any shadow wielder looking to rely solely on the Discipline as rooms without shadows are limiting. When Oblivion is used, if a 1 or a 10 is a result of the Rouse Check the user takes one stain in addition to any Hunger gained, and in cases where their [[Blood Potency]] allows for a reroll, they can pick either of the two results. <ref name=":0" />  

For the Lasombra Oblivion is a power wielded in a way to allow them to manipulate the darkness, controlling the shadows at their will either as a weapon or a tool. It has its uses as a method to attack a target with tendrils as seen with [[Oblivion#Arms of Ahriman|Arms of Ahriman]], as well as to bolster their intimidation techniques as they emerge from the shadows with [[Oblivion#Shadow Cloak|Shadow Cloak]]. The uses even extend into changing their form with [[Oblivion#Tenebrous Avatar|Tenebrous Avatar]] or stepping out from where they were not once standing with [[Oblivion#Shadow Step|Shadow Step]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Chicago by Night]], page 291</ref> As for the Hecata, the power takes a different path towards the undead and Necromancy. With the ability to locate and speak to the dead as seen with [[Oblivion#Binding Fetter|Binding Fetter]] and [[Oblivion#Oblivion Sight|Oblivion Sight]], or by manipulating and controlling the energies of death itself as displayed with [[Oblivion#Aura of Decay|Aura of Decay]]. Through these uses, the Hecata may set a spirit to attack their targets or rot everything around them in a show of power or simply to horrify meddling mortals. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 202</ref>
