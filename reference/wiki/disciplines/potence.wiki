==Overview==
Potence fuels the strength behind a hit, enhancing their strikes to a deceptive degree as a frail kindred decapitates a target with one hit. This vitae-fueled power up goes beyond simply being useful in a fight, as it also enables the user to force their body into actions impossible for most to replicate without it. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 263-264</ref> 

The [[Brujah]] use this power as a lethal weapon to cut short any confrontation they don't want to deal with and crack any skulls in their way. They also utilize their strengths with [[Presence]] to sway the crowds through [[Potence#Spark of Rage|Spark of Rage]]. While they may still feel a deeper connection to Humanity, in their hands this power is a devastating force. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 67</ref>Many [[Nosferatu]] hesitate to use this power in front of mortals as it will break their deceptive nature. However, when given no choice they understand better than most clans the need to hit and run. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 85</ref> Few [[Lasombra]] use this power to feed, instead favoring it for the eradication of an enemy with their hands or ripping through a door to command fear and respect.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Chicago by Night]], page 291</ref>
