__TOC__

==Overview==
Celerity allows the kindred to defy the constraints of the human body. Dodging, running and general movements outside of the natural ability come easily when using these powers. With this, kindred become even stronger predators or strategists, able to make moves or think faster than most can.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 252</ref>   

To the [[Banu Haqim]] this is sometimes the Discipline they learn first. The ability to remove hesitation keeps them alive in their nights and Celerity allows the movement they need. It also enhances their abilities to feed, being able to dart from their favored vessel and to safety without being spotted.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 167</ref> [[Brujah]], in a similar fashion, use this power to strike fast and escape conflicts they've started as well as bolster their ability to snatch and feed aggressively from lone mortals.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 67</ref> While the [[Toreador]] may not claim to be fighters, they use Celerity to cut their opponents into ribbons before they have a chance to fight back with deadly accuracy using [[Presence#Unerring Aim|Unerring Aim]]. They also use this power to enhance their artistic and performative pursuits as well as expedite their feeding.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 90</ref>
