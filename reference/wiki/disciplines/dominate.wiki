==Overview==
Dominate gives Kindred the ability to control the actions of others, alter their memories and force others to act not of their own volition. From erasing the memories of a recent feed to enslaving mortals for the vampire to do with them as they please. Dominate gives the feeling of power, although wiser Kindred know this is only a guise from the Blood. At most levels, it requires eye contact with a single victim unless otherwise stated. At the base levels, it can wipe superficial memories or command small immediate actions of their victims and in turn, higher levels allow for more sophisticated uses. The victim needs to understand the Kindred and the Kindred needs to speak their commands. Exceptions exist with [[Presence#Irresistible Voice|Irresistible Voice]] and [[Auspex#Telepathy|Telepathy]], the former allows commands without eye contact, and the latter without spoken words. While Dominated, victims are mindless puppets who cannot be interrogated and can only do things they could do on demand. Commands that cause social backlash or cause minor injury are always contested with the victim. The victim cannot be commanded to directly cause serious injury or death to themselves without [[Dominate#Terminal Decree|Terminal Decree]]. When used against other vampires they must contest this and those with a lower generation may use Willpower to shirk off the attempt. Once Dominate has totally failed against a target, the user will not be able to use it against them for the rest of the story. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 255</ref>

The [[Lasombra]] are shameless in their use of Dominate, enjoying crushing wills and commanding obedience callously.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Chicago by Night]], page 291</ref> Some [[Malkavian|Malkavians]] use Dominate to lift victims' minds from distraction or hide a messy feed, but the clan is infamous for [[Dominate#Dementation|Dementation]], used to shatter mortal and kindred minds alike.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 79</ref> The [[Salubri]] use Dominate to soothe others by removing troubling memories or fortify another kindred against their darker nature.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 14</ref> Rumor has it the [[Tremere]] use Dominate to hide their ruthless pursuits of knowledge.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 97</ref> In contrast, [[Tzimisce]] uses Dominate to acquire their possession, but also conditions servitors to never question their will. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 18</ref> [[Ventrue]] consider their mastery of Dominate to be absolute; bending victims, enemies, and followers to will as well as maintaining the [[Masquerade]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 102</ref>
