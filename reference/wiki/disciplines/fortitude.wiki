__TOC__

==Overview==
Fortitude allows vampires to resist both physical and mental attacks. The hardiness it creates helps many kindred survive and is a trait most immortal would seek out to survive the violence, fire, and supernatural coercion they experience during their nights.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 258</ref> 

The [[Gangrel]] who develop their strengths in this Discipline expect harm to come their way, serving as bodyguards or soldiers for other kindred. This also allows them to track and hunt prey in harsh environments. Their innate prowess with [[Animalism]] links them to their animals even more with [[Fortitude#Enduring Beasts|Enduring Beasts]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 72</ref>  [[Ventrue]] use this power to uphold their thrones even when armies amass against them, feeding in adverse situations. They never run short of vitae and always take their fill.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 102</ref>  While the [[Hecata]] are closer to death than any other clan, they use this power to keep above it. As attacks reign down upon them, they shrug them off and throwback with their Necromancy.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 202</ref>  The [[Salubri]] avoid elimination through the use of these powers, but also enhance it in their own way to aid others through the use of [[Fortitude#Valeren|Valeren]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 14</ref>
