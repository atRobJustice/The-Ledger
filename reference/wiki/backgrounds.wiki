==Backgrounds and Flaws==
Backgrounds help lay the foundation of who the vampire was in their mortal life before the game begins. They show what they were willing to leave behind after entering eternal unlife and what they wanted to maintain. When it comes to the more mundane problems Kindred might face, these are often the tools they use to counteract them. Sometimes these are not bought with the Coterie's pool but are still shared amongst the group and sometimes they are kept only to the Kindred themselves, they pick when and who they will share it with. These Flaws can also be taken independently of the Merit, for example, a player is not required to have dots in Haven in order to take the Haven Flaw: Creepy. It could manifest as an unsafe rundown house they know about and through the sessions remove the Flaw by converting it into a Merit and spending Experience Points.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], page 109</ref>

| id="Shared" |'''Shared'''
|'''(•) or (••)''' 
|The haven is not entirely owned by the character, instead being shared with other Kindred or having a Kindred landlord.

|'''Business Establishment'''
|'''•• - •••'''
|The haven is rented out to a business or is run as a business by the Kindred themselves. This gives both benefits and drawbacks, such as a ready stream of income but also being very much on the grid and local enforcement being aware of the location. This reduces the Haven’s base dots by one for pools involving the Haven’s privacy and defenses against either (pick one) financial or criminal intrusions.
