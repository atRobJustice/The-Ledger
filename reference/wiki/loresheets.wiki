<section begin=summary/>Loresheets are specific advantages tied to a character's background either through their lineage or their history. When looking at loresheets the players should consider how to tie them into their character's background and the plausibility of their implications together with their storyteller. Some loresheets require the character to be of a specific clan, especially Descendant loresheets, and others require certain cults. Players are able to take a Bloodline Loresheet in addition to a non-lineage Loresheet at Character Creation. Additionally, Storytellers may decide that Descendant loresheets are able to count as Bloodlines.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Cults of the Blood Gods]], page 219</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], page 114</ref><section end=summary/>

All loresheets contain a dot value from 1 to 5. Each level of a loresheet must be bought separately, meaning that having level 3 in a loresheet does not mean the character also has levels 1 and 2.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 190</ref>
