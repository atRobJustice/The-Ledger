==Backgrounds and Flaws==
Backgrounds describe advantages of relationship, circumstance, and opportunity: material possessions, social networks, and the like. Backgrounds are external Traits, not internal, and the player should always rationalize how the character came to possess them, as well as what they represent. Who are your Contacts? Why do your Allies support you? Where did you meet your Retainers? What investments do you possess that yield your four dots in Resources? You don’t have to do all of that at first – but be ready with an answer when the Storyteller asks during play, or be ready to suggest an answer that ties into the ongoing storyline. The implication here is that no small amount of a Hunter’s Background may be connected to a time when they had worked for an org. Certainly, a Hunter’s story doesn’t have to include a connection to orgs -- it’s perfectly possible to have Allies of one’s own -- but no few Hunters originally began in service to orgs and eventually grew disillusioned with them, leaving to go their own way and leave the orgs’ mechanisms of social control behind.

Backgrounds are discrete, not progressive, Traits. The same Background can be acquired multiple times.<ref name="CB72"/>
