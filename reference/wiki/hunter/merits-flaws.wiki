==Merits and Flaws==
Merits describe knacks, gifts, and just plain good fortune inherent to the character: Physical, Mental, and Social. Although something could happen in the course of play to change them – especially once weird inexplicable magic gets unleashed — characters’ Merits remain fairly constant over the course of the story.
