==What are Edges?==
<section begin=summary/>Edges are a representation of a wide variety of advantages that put Hunters above the average person when dealing with the supernatural.<section end=summary/> Edges do not have a rating; instead, players can purchase additional Perks. Most Perks can only be obtained once. However, some, for example, creature specialization can be learned multiple times, with no limit on the amount of Perks a Hunter may have in an Edge.

Edges are divided into three categories: Assets, Aptitudes, and Endowments. <ref>[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 89</ref>

==Assets==
Asset Edges represent access to items, tools, or contacts that a typical private citizen wouldn't be able to obtain. <ref>[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 90</ref>
===Arsenal===
Either borrowed from an old contact or put together in a garage, the Hunter has access to a wide variety of weapons that are generally not available to the public. This includes not only firearms but also melee weapons; however, this does not include explosives such as bombs, mines, or other munitions. These weapons are still mundane and are only available for a short period of time, either having to be returned to the contact, undergo severe maintenance, or break down due to their nature of being jerry-rigged.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]] for the Hunter who keeps and maintains their own arsenal. [[Manipulation]] + [[Streetwise]] for the Hunter who relies on contacts.

'''System:''' The Hunter is able to provide a single personal firearm or melee weapon upon winning a test at Difficulty 4. This test is made at the start of a scene, and the Hunter must have plausible access to their supplies or contacts. It can only be attempted once per scene, and the weapon can only be used for that scene, but later tests can provide the same or a similar weapon. <ref name="CB90-91">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 90-91</ref>

===Fleet===
Either borrowed from a reliable contact or put together in a garage, the Hunter has access to a wide variety of personal or commercial vehicles on short notice. This does not include military vehicles such as tanks or attack aircraft.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Intelligence]] + [[Technology]] for the Hunter who keeps and maintains their own fleet. [[Manipulation]] + [[Persuasion]] for the Hunter who relies on contacts.

'''System:''' The Hunter is able to provide a single vehicle for either public or commercial use, including boats and aircraft, upon winning a test at Difficulty 4. Outlandish requests should be vetted by the Storyteller with increasing Difficulty as needed. This test is made at the start of a scene, and the Hunter must have plausible access to their garage or contact. It can only be attempted once per scene, and the vehicle can only be used for that scene, but later tests can provide the same or a similar vehicle. This Edge does not grant the ability to pilot the vehicles provided. <ref name="CB91-92">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 91-92</ref>

===Ordnance===
Either obtained through one or many connections or put together by the Hunter themselves, the Hunter has access to various types of timed or remotely detonated munitions. Examples of these are anti-vehicle mines, C4 explosives, or demolition charges.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Composure]] + [[Science]] for the Hunter who builds their own ordnance. [[Composure]] + [[Streetwise]] for the Hunter who relies on contacts.

'''System:''' The Hunter is able to provide a single mine or explosive upon winning a test at Difficulty 4. This test is made at the start of a scene and the Hunter must have plausible access to their supplies or contacts.

===Library===
The Hunter has access to a wealth of information on a wide variety of topics and creatures through either a library filled with centuries-old texts or an encrypted database with all the latest research on the supernatural.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Resolve]] + [[Academics]]

'''System:''' The Hunter must spend about a day researching their quarry before making an Edge test. The Storyteller decides what type of clue they receive upon a win and how vague it is, with the clarity and amount of information increasing based on the margin of the win. This can only be attempted once per scene, and once the Hunter succeeds, it cannot be used again until the next session. <ref name="CB93">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 93</ref>

===Experimental Medicine===
Whether it's drugs or medicine, the Hunter has an indefinite waiver to a medical team to perform whatever experiments on them in exchange for swift, free medical care.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Stamina]] + [[Medicine]] for [[Health]], [[Composure]] + [[Insight]] for [[Willpower]]

'''System:''' Whenever the Hunter has one or more Aggravated damage, they may undergo this experimental procedure, Difficulty equal to half the subject's current amount of Aggravated damage (rounded up). Winning heals completely, failing inflicts the appropriate Impaired status for the story's duration and raises Danger by 1. <ref name="A19">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Apostates]], page 19</ref>

|For the duration of the next story, the Hunter heals [[Health]] twice as quickly, and Aggravated damage downgraded to Superficial. However, they can't use [[Drive]] for [[Desperation]] dice. When effect ends, they gain Aggravated Willpower damage equal to the times this Perk was used.
|id="Unstable Steroids"|'''Unstable Steroids'''
|One of the Hunter's Attributes is increased by one until the end of the next story. Should they achieve [[Despair]] on any tests before that, they also suffer 1 Aggravated damage. <ref name="A19" />
|}

==Aptitudes==
Aptitudes are Edges that, while not supernatural, defy what is normally able to be accomplished by those with skill and instruction. <ref name="CB93" />
===Improvised Gear===
With the objects and materials nearby, the Hunter is able to create any number of short-lived but useful tools to aid the cell.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]]/[[Technology]]/[[Science]] depending on the tool or substance being made.

'''System:''' The Hunter is able to provide short-lived but useful equipment from ordinary items upon winning a test at Difficulty 4. This item can add to the use of a single Skill by adding a two-dice advantage at the Storyteller's discretion. It can also make certain actions that would have been impossible possible for the Hunters. The amount of time needed to create this item is determined by the Storyteller and may range from a few minutes to several hours. Creating these under duress, such as a firefight, is not possible. These items only last through one scene, and unless they have the associated perks, Hunters can only make one per scene. <ref name="CB94">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 94</ref>

|'''Specialization'''
| Specializing in a specific Skill, the Hunter now can produce items that have a 3-dice bonus instead of 2. This perk can be taken multiple times, but only once per Skill.
|id="Speed Crafting"|'''Speed Crafting'''
|This Edge can now be used under duress, such as in firefights, and the Hunter crafts the tool in three turns minus the margin of the test. There is a minimum of one turn to create the item. <ref name="CB94"/>
|}

===Global Access===
The Hunter is able to accomplish feats of digital larceny well beyond what a normal hacker is able to.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Intelligence]] + [[Technology]]

'''System:''' To use this Edge, the Hunter must spend the equivalent of a scene (the length of time being determined by the Storyteller). The Hunter is then able to obtain data on any subject or person in any database, ranging from surveillance to buried records, upon winning a test at Difficulty 4. Without the associated Perks, this data may not be manipulated, and in the case of non-networked systems, the Hunter must have physical access to the local network. <ref name="CB94-95">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 94-95</ref>

|-id="Money Trap"
|'''Money Trap'''
|The Hunter can manipulate financial data and move money with little effort. This can be used to deprive prey or enemies of financial assets or guide authoritarian eyes toward something suspicious. This lowers the level of Resources of a target, when used offensively, by one per margin of the test. This reduction lasts for one month. The Storyteller should decide how this affects the Hunters when they use it for personal gain, with at least an increase in Danger as they line their own pockets. 
|id="The Letter of the Law"|'''The Letter of the Law'''
|The Hunter can manipulate criminal records. Making their enemies wanted criminals or erasing another's mistakes. The Difficulty ranges from 3 (local offenses) to 5 (global scale) when attempting to wipe or place them on someone else. .<ref name="CB94-95" />

|}

===Drone Jockey===
The Hunter has a drone that surpasses those that are commercially available. They are also able to control it expertly and repair it on their own. The type of drone varies, either as a tool for surveillance or for combat.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Wits]] + [[Technology]] for flying the drone. [[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]] to either repair or rebuild it.

'''System:''' When obtained, the drone is equipped to perform two [[Skills]]. For example, a walking drone with armor might be able to perform [[Athletics]] and [[Brawl]]; a surveillance drone might perform [[Stealth]] and [[Awareness]]. The type of drone that a Hunter uses is determined when the Edge is obtained, and more variants may be obtained through the Perks. When a controller tests the Skill of the drone, either through the hand-held device or hardwired computer, they use their [[Wits]] + [[Technology]] instead of the usual pool. If the drone must make a Skill test for a Skill they do not possess, they use a one-die pool.

The drone has an unlimited range, and can stay active for one day plus additional days equal to the margin of a test made of [[Intelligence]] + [[Science]] at Difficulty 2. Drones have five health levels, with ground drones treating damage as Superficial and flying drones treating damage as Aggravated. By spending the equivalent of a scene and making a test of [[Intelligence]] + [[Craft]] at Difficulty 3, the Hunter may repair the damage of a drone by the number of health equal to the margin of the test. This can also be done on destroyed drones, but they must be fully restored before they can be used again. <ref name="CB95-96">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 95-96</ref>

|id="Variants"|'''Variants'''
|This Perk can be taken multiple times and allows an additional drone variant (complete with two [[Skills]] unrelated to previous drones). Only one drone can be active at a time, unless the Autonomous Perk is used to run them.
|-id="Specialist Skill"
|'''Specialist Skill'''
|This drone can obtain an additional [[Skill]], and if the Storyteller agrees, this can also include the drone carrying items or manipulating the environment. Some examples are [[Larceny]] with a set of electronic picks or [[Science]] with an onboard mobile lab. This Perk only applies to one drone but can be taken multiple times for additional drones.
|id="Armaments"|'''Armaments'''
| The drone is equipped with the equivalent of a submachine gun or taser, which uses a flat five-dice pool. The Specialist Skill Perk allows the controller to use their [[Wits]] + [[Technology]] when directly controlling the drone.
|-id="Payload"
|'''Payload'''
| The drone can carry cargo many times bigger than what it would seem to be able to carry. While carrying cargo, the drone moves slower and grants two-dice to those attempting to detect it. This drone will not subdue a resisting cargo, and the size of the drone should be agreed upon by the Storyteller and player before it's used. <ref name="CB95-96" />

===Beast Whisperer===
Some species of animals may be understood by and loyal to the Hunter. Thus, they are dependable companions and occasionally even friends.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Charisma]] + [[Animal Ken]] for commands, [[Composure]] + [[Animal Ken]] for training.

'''System:''' When taking this Edge this Hunter must choose one type of animal and which key action pool it has. This animal is considered completely loyal and will accompany a Hunter into any situation as long as it is desired. <ref name="CB96">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 96</ref>

|The animal can now stay out of sight, hiding either just out of observed range or blending into environments. The Storyteller should determine the plausibility of this in certain situations, depending on the animal. <ref name="CB96" />

===Turncoat===
The Hunter is a double agent, working with their cell to get on the inside with the Quarry. The Quarry fully believing in their loyalty completely.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Manipulation]] + [[Subterfuge]]

'''System:''' The Hunter makes an Edge test vs Difficulty equaling half the target's [[Intelligence]] + [[Wits]] or standard Difficulty. Target now believes the Hunter is 100% loyal to them. <ref name="A1819">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Apostates]], page 18-19</ref>

==Endowments==
Endowments are Edges that go beyond what is natural. These are abilities that may seem magical or superhuman; most Endowments focus on an object, and should these objects be lost, they are easily replaced. <ref name="CB97">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 97</ref>
===Sense the Unnatural===
While holding an object of focus, the Hunter is able to detect the nearby presence of supernatural creatures. However, this ability does not determine who or what the creature is.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Wits]] + [[Occult]] or [[Science]], depending on the Endowment's nature.

'''System:''' Upon winning an Edge test with a Difficulty of 3-5 (ranging on the type of creature and its power), the Hunter will be able to detect if there is a presence. The Hunter must hold their object of focus, with its use being intentional and obvious. In order to use this power more than once per scene, it requires spending one point of [[Willpower]] for each additional attempt. <ref name="CB97" />

===Repel the Unnatural===
By brandishing or otherwise using an object of focus, the Hunter is able to repel supernatural creatures.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Resolve]] + [[Occult]] or [[Science]] depending on the Endowment's nature.

'''System:''' Upon winning an Edge test with a Difficulty set by the Storyteller (Default is half the creature's Composure + Resolve or just the standard Difficulty of the creature), the creature can be held back by the Hunter as long as they remain stationary with their object of focus. When repelled, creatures cannot move closer or engage them in brawl, but they are able to defend themselves and use any of their other powers. Should the Hunter move, they must make the Edge test for each turn spent moving with the same pool and Difficulty as before. If they lose, the repelling stops and cannot be used on the same creature again for the duration of the scene. <ref name="CB98">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 98</ref>

===Thwart the Unnatural===
Using an object of focus, the Hunter is highly resistant to any supernatural abilities that affect the mind.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Composure]] + [[Occult]] or [[Science]], depending on the nature of the Endowment.

'''System:''' While holding their object of focus, a Hunter is immune to supernatural abilities that would otherwise require a resistance test. For abilities that would automatically affect them, the Hunter may instead resist with an Edge test. This only applies to attempts that target the Hunter specifically and not to purely physical attacks or augmentations. For example, this would protect against mind control, but not against a creature attempting to rip them into pieces with their claws.<ref name="CB98-99">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 98-99</ref>

===Artifact===
The Hunter has obtained a rare tool, whatever it is, that provides more than a similar object would.

'''Edge Pool:''' [[Intelligence]] + [[Occult]] or [[Science]], depending on the Artifact's nature.

'''System:''' The relic provides the Hunter with a one-dice bonus to a single [[Skill]] associated with it, however, this bonus does not apply to Edge tests for the Artifact. This can be used as an object of focus if it meets the requirements. Unlike other objects of focus, though, if it is lost, it requires a long ordeal to regain it. <ref name="CB99-100">[[Hunter: The Reckoning Corebook]], page 99-100</ref>
