==Overview==
The Kindred ability to dominate a social scene as flawlessly as their hunting ground is embodied by Presence. Skilled Kindred cause others to feel irresistible allure or unfettered dread within mere moments. Presence is a potent emotional manipulation to score easy victims, coerce devotion, and sail through social settings. 

While Dominate is a handy tool to bend others to one’s will, it is not as subtle as presence. Presence isn’t direct control, but influence leaves victims with their ability to think; making those affected more useful for manipulation, but unpredictable. To use this discipline, the victim needs to be physically present or within earshot of the Kindred. Without [[Presence#Star Magnetism|Star Magnetism]] the power cannot transmit over electronics. While Presence is a subtle Discipline without overt uses or obvious clues, [[Auspex]] such as [[Auspex#Sense the Unseen|Sense the Unseen]] can detect its use at the moment, and [[Fortitude#Unswayable Mind|Unswayable Mind]] can be used when contesting the supernatural influence. Presence powers do not stack and only [[Presence#Dread Gaze|Dread Gaze]] and [[Presence#Majesty|Majesty]] can be used on violent enemies, as their minds can’t be charmed when they have decided to hurt the Kindred.

To sway the crowd either towards violence or towards their own goals, the [[Brujah]] find use in this power. The intellectual types in the clan use this power to convince their victims to give up blood voluntarily while others use it to terrify their prey before they feed.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 67</ref> [[Ravnos]] use this when their natural charm isn't enough. Few Ravnos exist without some skill in this power and make frequent use of it to find a victim in a short amount of time, it also plays its part in their illusion magics in [[Obfuscate]]. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Companion]], page 8</ref> [[Toreador]] are thought to be masters of this discipline, spurring the audience to cheer a performer, lure victims, or to make unnaturally devoted thralls. They are known to use it alongside Auspex to manipulate others such as crystallizing their presence in creations with [[Presence#Magnus Opus|Magnus Opus]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 90</ref> Within [[The Ministry]] the ability to influence emotions is vital, used with subtle tactics they rally their congregations and pierce their heart strings or target someone looking for their next fix. Mixed with their mastery of [[Protean]] they contain the ability to use [[Presence#Eyes of the Serpent|Eyes of the Serpent]] to control those who retaliate against them.<ref name=":03">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 184</ref> Building love and admiration in their courts [[Ventrue]] find this a useful tool at their disposal. With their natural affinity within [[Dominate]], the use of [[Presence#Clear the Field|Clear the Field]] and [[Presence#Irresistible Voice|Irresistible Voice]] aids them when things are going south. With the clan valuing time and resources, Presence allows them to make hunting nothing more than a quick stop and be efficient.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 102</ref>
