==Skills==
Similar to Attributes, Skills are defined as follows: No dots means they have no knowledge or formal training, one being that they have basic knowledge, two is general knowledge, three is a professional Skill level, four means they've specialized in this, and five is mastery of the Skill.

The distribution of Skills is a choice between three different options:

*'''Jack of All Trades:''' One Skill at 3 dots, eight Skills at 2 dots, and ten Skills at 1 dot.
*'''Balanced:''' Three Skills at 3 dots, five Skills at 2 dots, and seven Skills at 1 dot.
*'''Specialist:''' One Skill at 4 dots, three Skills at 3 dots, three Skills at 2 dots, and three Skills at 1 dot.

Following this is Skill specialty, which is specific expertise in a given Skill. If the players have allotted dots into the Skills Academics, Craft, Performance, and/or Science they will need to choose a free specialty for those with dots. Then they will have one more additional free specialty to place in any Skill. Remember that characters can only have a specialty in a Skill for as many dots as they have except in specific cases such as the Craft Skill.
