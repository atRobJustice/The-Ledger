== General ==
'''Caitiff''' exhibit no discernible lineage, the Caitiff are vampires without a clan. Distrusted by their peers, they are scorned because of their lack of lineage but also feared for their unpredictability. Jacks of all trades but masters of none, each Pander makes their own way in the society of the damned, free from ancestry and expectations both.<ref>[https://www.worldofdarkness.com/vampire-the-masquerade-clans Vampire: The Masquerade Clans section], World of Darkness Website</ref>

Representative of vampires in their purest form, the Caitiff do not suffer from the lineage of their Blood. Due to this, they are usually cast out by their clans either from shame, envy, or fear. The Caitiff take their distance either in shame or pride, born from the unique traits missing from their sire's clan. Caitiff embraces are not always accidental; it's assumed that the clanless do not target mortals for the embrace, but that is incorrect. In the modern night, the Panders are becoming an increasingly large force. As survivors, most do not gather together, and without their binding blood, they are more individualistic than those within clans. The mortals they seek for the embrace are generally strong-willed or accustomed to hardship. Their position in Kindred society is the bottom of the rung, after all, only above the [[Thin-blood]] who shouldn't have been created at all. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 105-106</ref> 

== Disciplines ==
Caitiff have access to all Disciplines, but remember they are not considered in-clan even if taken at Character Creation.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 107</ref> Additional purchases of Disciplines come at a cost of 6 times the level in experience.

== Bane ==
<section begin=bane/>'''Outcast''' - Untouched by their ancestors, the Caitiff do not share a common Bane. The character begins with the Flaw Suspect (•) and they may not purchase positive status during Character Creation. The Storyteller may impose a 1-2 dice penalty to social tests against Kindred who know they are Caitiff. To improve a Discipline, the cost is 6 times the level of experience points.<section end=bane/><ref name=":0" />

== Compulsion ==
<section begin=compulsion/>Caitiff do not have a clan Compulsion.<section end=compulsion/>

== Example archetypes ==
* '''Secret Caitiff''' - Biding their time, the Caitiff knows that they are not a member of the clan, but has learned the ins and outs of their sire's clan and with great skill replicates the bane or avoids all situations that might show their true nature.
* '''Unwanted Childe''' - There was nothing more than the idea of a strong childe that their sire wanted, but instead they were given a childe without their lineage flowing through their veins. In turn, the Caitiff was cast out, and rejected by those in their clan.
== Notable characters ==
'''Maldavis''' - Born Carol Davis, she had a run-in with a man that looked like her late great-uncle  Abraham DuSable. The night ended with the [[Tremere]] Embracing her, but the Blood failing to take her into the clan. Taken in by Anarchs, she soon counted herself among the Movement. She worked quickly making a name for herself and rivaling former Chicago Prince Lodin. She was secretly backed and manipulated by some Primogen malcontents. She fought bravely and seemingly almost won Chicago, but Lodin made peace with her backers. She was betrayed and defeated by a unified Camarilla. Her closest allies died in an attempt to save her. She spent decades in depression, but with Kevin Jackson as Prince, she is filled with her old drive. She is ready to guide the Anarchs of Chicago once again.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Chicago by Night]], page 102-104</ref>

'''[[Alejandra Deluna]]''' - Fledgling posing as childe of [[Cecily Bain]].<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Winter's Teeth]]</ref>

== Culture ==
=== Embrace ===
When a Kindred from a clan tries to Embrace there is a small chance something goes wrong, either the nature of the embrace or a mutation of the Blood in their new childe. The Embrace takes, but it doesn’t carry on the clan bane or subtle attraction clans have for one another. Theories include Frenzy Embraces, weak human stock, supernatural phenomena, etc., but no theory has ever been proven.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 152</ref> The childe of these odd embraces are often abandoned, exiled, or choose to leave themselves. A rumor circulates within Kindred circles that Caitiff are only made this way and the clanless never pursue the embrace, this is absolutely not true. While many Caitiff are a result of the Embrace not passing on the Clan Curse and affinity for Disciplines, Caitiff may decide to Embrace for reasons all their own, continuing the creation of Caitiff. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], Page 106</ref>

=== Mortal Society ===
While Caitiff vary greatly from one another, especially those Embraced by a Kindred with a clan, there are some noticeable niches. Through the need to survive they manipulate mortals and weave webs of deceptions to protect themselves. From either ostracism or Kindred politics, hunting is a dangerous game for Caitiff; so many have taken to cultivating large herds to safely feed on without poaching other Kindred lands; others have adopted services like the Circulatory System. Some Caitiff treat their herd and vessels as a tasting ground for new resonances to power their mutable Blood. Whatever the means the Caitiff often tell themselves they are better than most Kindred. This is just lying to themselves as they manipulate and use mortals all the same, for they need to survive and are still Kindred at the end of the night.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 154</ref><ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], Page 106</ref>

=== Kindred Society ===
Caitiff are thought to be an omen of the end times according to the Church of Caine. Many other Kindred view them with distrust and some Caitiff themselves feel they do not belong among the Kindred Clan even if they have the rare sire willing to overlook their condition. This places the Caitiff at the bottom of the hierarchy right above the Thin-blood. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], Page 105</ref>

Whether it is through a blood-borne impulse, shared identity, or similar experiences, many clans are somewhat drawn to another clan mate to a minute degree, but the Caitiff lack this completely. While other Kindred can reflect on lineage or mutual unlife experience, the Caitiff lack this, even with other Caitiff.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 152</ref> Though Caitiff will still form coteries in order to survive as self preservation is paramount. Many are slow to trust which may strain a coterie, but willing to see where a prospective coterie goes if the other Kindred manage to work with them they can become ardent supporters of the group. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], Page 190</ref>

An enterprising Caitiff can turn their ambition to do anything and knowledge of the fringes into a profit. Many turn to being hired guns, a claness Scourge is not a rare sight these nights in the Camarilla and Ashirra, as they know how to best find and hunt down Thin-bloods. In the Anarch Movement they were on the frontline. They become useful tools or even pets for the powerful Kindred of the domain. Many Caitiff are stuck as enforcers rather than officers due to clan elitism, but some do strive to be leaders of the domain. Those strong-willed Caitiff that strive to be Prince or Baron must endure ridicule and prejudice for flying above their station. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 152</ref> <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], Page 125</ref>

The night used to be perilous when elders would call for the extermination of all Caitiff. There is still danger for Caitiff in the night as Princes stuck in old traditions may still endorse the hunting and slaughter of the clanless for sport. In other Domains the woes of the city are blamed on the Freestylers. The Church of Caine is forever their enemy as they go against all doctrine. This and their mutable blood pairs them with Thin-bloods, something the Caitiff aids the Duskborn and other times they are chips sacrificed to save the Clanless’ unlife. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], Page 125</ref>

=== Factional Differences ===

Caitff of the Anarch movement are sometimes seen as the best example of being Unbound. No connection to hierarchy or blood curses. Even while the Caitiff are seemingly praised for their clanless nature, many still feel the sting of ostracism. Unable to relate to the Gangrel, Tzimisce,  Brujah, or Minister as they are able to connect with members of their own. The faction too has Caitiff passed over for status, serving on the front line, and pressed to sell out those lower than them for usefulness. Even though many were part of the movement before the Caitiff’s seniority got passed over for their cousins in a clan: the Ministry and the Brujah. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Anarch]], page 152</ref> 

Some set out to find a place in the Ivory Tower, the '''''Panders''''' are Caitiff who ignore the Tower’s years of bias for crumbs of power and status. Some domains required sponsors for Caitiff to even be admitted. That being said, the Ivory Tower does see the light when it comes to Caitiff usefulness, often acquiring them as scourges and doers of dirty jobs. These Panders are willing to sink low and attack Thin-bloods either as a scourge or hounds for a bit of status. Of course, they never get as much acclaim as an equivalent Kindred of a clan. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Camarilla]], page 117</ref>

There are many Caitiff who have found Kindred society is a losing game of manipulation and gaslighting. These clanless don’t have a formal name but are filled with cynicism at being used with false hope by the Movement and like pawn pieces by the Camarilla. They typically call Caitiff that associate with the Movement or Tower “sellouts.” <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], Page 125</ref>
