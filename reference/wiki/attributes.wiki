From these players can derive a few more traits.

*'''[[Health]]:''' Stamina+3
==Overview==
A character's health is derived from their Stamina + 3. In general, it is received during physical conflicts with a contest being made. The margin of the winner's roll against the losers is added to the loser's health tracker as damage. If the winner is using a weapon with a modifier, that is added to the total damage with the margin. There are two different types of damage that can fill a character's health tracker, Superficial damage and Aggravated damage.

When tracking damage to their health tracker, Superficial damage is tracked with an "/" on one of the boxes per point taken, with Aggravated tracked using an "X" in each box per point taken. If a character manages to fill their entire tracker, either with one type or a mix of the two, they are now Impaired. Impairment causes a penalty of -2 from Physical pools. Following this impairment, any point of damage they take will convert any Superficial into Aggravated on a one-for-one basis. When a character's tracker is filled entirely with Aggravated damage they are out of the combat, if they are mortal they are either dead or comatose and if they are Kindred they fall into [[Torpor]].

===Superficial damage===
Superficial damage is bruising and small cuts, but nothing that is life-threatening. Kicking, punching, and any non-lethal weapon do Superficial damage to humans. Standard weapons do Superficial damage to vampires, this includes slashing, stabbing, and piercing weapons. In general, this type of damage is halved before adding it to the tracker and this includes when converting Superficial to Aggravated.

===Aggravated damage===
Aggravated damage is broken bones, serious wounds, and other life-threatening injuries. Sharp and piercing weapons do Aggravated damage to humans. Generally, only fire, sunlight and the claws or teeth of other supernatural creatures do Aggravated damage to Kindred.

===Healing damage===
Mortals may remove a number of Superficial damage equal to their Stamina rating at the beginning of a session. With Aggravated damage mortals can have their damage converted from Aggravated to Superficial with an Intelligence + Medicine test. The maximum amount able to be converted is equal to half of the character's Medicine rating rounded up with the healing happening over the course of the night. A mortal being hospitalized removes the need for rolls but takes the amount of Aggravated damage received as the total number of weeks required to heal fully. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 126-127</ref>

When healing Superficial damage Kindred can remove a number of Superficial damage levels from their Health tracker by making one [[Rouse Check]] per turn, with the number removed dependent on their [[Blood Potency]]. With Aggravated damage, Kindred may mend one level of Aggravated damage by making three Rouse Checks at the beginning of a session in addition to the wake-up Rouse Check. This will only heal one point of damage and will remove any Crippling Injury or similar impairments, this can only be done once per night.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 218-219</ref>

*'''[[Willpower]]:''' Composure + Resolve <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 157</ref>
==Overview==
Willpower is a tracker, with both a maximum rating and a temporary amount of points to be used. It represents the character's confidence and determination to accomplish a task and is built from Composure + Resolve. It is not possible to purchase additional points of Willpower alone, instead, it is only increased by increasing either one of those stats.

===Spending Willpower===
Players may spend their character's Willpower in a variety of ways and when doing so, must mark the tracker with one Superficial damage. Should the character hit Willpower 0, they are left Impaired and receives a -2 dice penalty for Social and Mental tests. Superficial damage is tracked with an "/" on one of the boxes per point taken, with Aggravated tracked using an "X" in each box per point taken.
* They may use Willpower to reroll up to three dice (the dice cannot be Hunger dice) in any pool, except when the rules specifically exclude Willpower such as tracker rolls ([[Humanity#Remorse|Remorse]] tests, [[Frenzy]] tests), or One-Roll Conflict), etc.
* Willpower may be spent to take control of their character for one turn during a frenzy or when under the influence of certain [[Disciplines]].
* To perform minor movements, such as movement of a finger while staked.
* To ignore [[Health]] damage penalties, including Impairment, for one turn.

===Recovering Superficial Willpower damage===
* Characters may recover their Superficial Willpower damage at the beginning of a session equal to either their Composure or Resolve (whichever is highest between the two). Unless, the session ends on a cliffhanger where the dwindling supply of Willpower provides a strong dramatic tension.
* At the [[Storyteller|Storyteller's]] discretion, once per session, a character who acts to fulfill their desire may immediately recover 1 point of damage.
* At the Storyteller's discretion, a character who plays out a [[Hunger system#Messy Critical|messy critical]], [[Hunger system#Bestial Failure|bestial failure]], [[Frenzy|frenzy]], or [[Compulsion]] in a dramatic way can recover one or more Superficial Willpower damage.

===Recovering Aggravated Willpower damage===
* At the Storyteller's discretion, a character can recover one or more points of Aggravated Willpower damage when they have acted to significantly benefit a Touchstone, or by following a Conviction to their determent.
* Characters can heal 1 point of Aggravated damage at the end of a session when the character has worked towards their Ambition.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 158-159</ref>

*'''[[Humanity]]:''' The base Humanity for a neonate and lower is 7, not including any changes from their Predator types. It is possible for a fresh embrace to begin at Humanity 8. <ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 149</ref> 
The Humanity score represents how close a Kindred remains to their human nature, to specific people vital to them, and how easily they slip away from human concerns and instead towards the whims of the [[beast|Beast]].

__TOC__

==Overview==
Most vampires will begin to drop in Humanity over time with neonates and ancillas sitting around Humanity 5.<ref name=":2">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 238</ref> A vampire player character will start at Humanity 7 unless particular circumstances alter this such as [[predator types|Predator types]]. Those that are freshly [[Embrace|Embraced]] will begin at Humanity 8. Kindred are monsters, regardless of their rating and even the most saintly and highest of Humanity vampires can be morally corrupt. As their Humanity rating changes over the course of time, it's important to keep track of the changes that will occur. As their rating deteriorates over time, their connections alter and soon they might find themselves holding the corpse of a human they had originally never intended to kill.<ref name=":0">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 236</ref>

==The Humanity Track==
[[File:Humanity 7 tracker.png|thumb|A Humanity 7 character's tracker]]
The Humanity tracker contains 10 spaces, with the Humanity rating filled from left to right.

=== Stains ===
Stains are what damage Humanity and are caused by significant actions. Those actions may include embracing a new childe, harming a touchstone, breaching their own convictions or the chronicle tenets. Tenet Stains can be negated by a character's [[Conviction]] if it was broken in alignment of their Conviction, reducing the amount of Stains gained by one or more. The amount of Stains earned can vary from clear violations giving only 1 and with truly monstrous or egregious breaks netting 2 or more. Fill the amount of Stains exceeds the amount of empty spaces in the tracker ''degeneration'' is triggered.<ref name=":3" />
[[File:Humanity 7 tracker 2 stains.png|thumb|A Humanity 7 character's tracker with two Stains]]
When taking Stains, the tracker fills in from right to left with slash marks to differentiate the Stains from Humanity.

=== Remorse ===
When a character has Stains in their tracker at the end of a session they will make a Remorse test. The Remorse pool is composed of how many empty spaces are left between the Humanity and the amount of Stains taken. In the case of a Humanity 7 character with only one Stain, they'd roll two dice. However, in cases where there are no spaces left, such as a Humanity 7 character with three Stains, they'd still roll 1 die. Any amount of successes means that the character has felt enough guilt, shame and remorse than their Humanity will not drop. If they do not any successes, the beast has won and they must drop 1 Humanity. Once the remorse test is completed, all Stains are removed.<ref name=":3" />

=== Degeneration ===
In cases where they have taken more Stains than they have room for, the character becomes ''impaired''. This type of impairment removes two dice from all possible pools as they are racked with regret. In addition to this, they take one point of Aggravated [[Willpower]] damage for each Stain that did not fit onto the tracker. During this time, the character is unable of further intentional Tenet violations and upon being forced to commit one must test for a terror [[frenzy]] with Difficulty 4. This impairment will remain until they test for Remorse at the end of the session, alternatively they may choose to snap out of it by automatically dropping by one Humanity point and removing all Stains.<ref name=":3" />
