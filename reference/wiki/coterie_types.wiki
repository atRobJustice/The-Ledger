''For additional Merits and Flaws specific to [[Coterie|coteries]] as well as further information regarding mechanics listed here, see [[Coterie Backgrounds and Merits]].''

== How to use coterie types ==
Players have the option to create their coterie type from those below or invent their own. Below are examples of possible types with names that serve as a shorthand rather than a universal term amongst Kindred. Yes, some may call their coterie a Nomad, but they do not have to. Build the coterie around what the troupe desires first and rules second. If a coterie type matches well, use it's requirements but if there are things the players would rather have instead, swap it around with different pre-requisites. In a similar vein, coterie types can change in play. Perhaps the Nomad coterie has found a city they wish to settle down in, changing around their advantages will help represent their current storyline.<ref>[[Vampire: The Masquerade Players Guide]], page 155</ref>

Mechanically when using these types, subtract the listed costs from the coterie pool. If the pool isn't large enough to pay the costs of that type, start collecting contributions from the characters. You can increase any listed value with your remaining coterie pool if there is any. Consider the possible extras as more places to put the remaining pool.<ref name=":2">[[Vampire: The Masquerade Corebook]], page 197</ref>

At the Storytellers discretion some coterie types grant a single dot bonus to one of the domain traits if the coterie meets all the pre-requisites listed. This bonus does not raise a domain trait above five, if a coterie changes types or otherwise changes to receive a bonus that would increase the trait above five either refund a coterie dot or the experience spent by a player character.
