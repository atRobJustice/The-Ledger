    "overview": "Obfuscate is a power that allows the Kindred to hide easily, move without being noticed, and cast illusions. It gives users the ability to get close to victims or disguise themselves as well as give them an out when a situation gets too complicated. The power itself is not invisibility, instead, it works through mental magic, tricking the mind of others to ignore the kindred presence or see a mundane face instead. Unless otherwise stated Obfuscate affects all five senses and coaxes victims to step out of the way to the point of rationalizing to themselves about why they are avoiding that particular corner. However, there are limitations to this power. The power will fail if the victim cannot ignore the user such as being backed into a corner or being blocked from a doorway they wish to walk through. As well as violent actions, loud noises or failed rolls to tamper with items. Without Ghost in the Machine, the kindred is easily recognized by machine surveillance. Users of Sense the Unseen, are able to roll against these powers, as well as those about to be struck by a sneak attack. Without the use of Vanish, users are unable to use Obfuscate while under observation from others.",
