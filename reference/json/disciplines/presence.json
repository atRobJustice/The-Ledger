    "overview": "The Kindred ability to dominate a social scene as flawlessly as their hunting ground is embodied by Presence. Skilled Kindred cause others to feel irresistible allure or unfettered dread within mere moments. Presence is a potent emotional manipulation to score easy victims, coerce devotion, and sail through social settings. While Dominate is a handy tool to bend others to one's will, it is not as subtle as presence. Presence isn't direct control, but influence leaves victims with their ability to think; making those affected more useful for manipulation, but unpredictable. To use this discipline, the victim needs to be physically present or within earshot of the Kindred. Without Star Magnetism the power cannot transmit over electronics. While Presence is a subtle Discipline without overt uses or obvious clues, Auspex such as Sense the Unseen can detect its use at the moment, and Unswayable Mind can be used when contesting the supernatural influence. Presence powers do not stack and only Dread Gaze and Majesty can be used on violent enemies, as their minds can't be charmed when they have decided to hurt the Kindred.",
